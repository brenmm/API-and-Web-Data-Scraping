0,Forrest Gump,"A man with a low IQ has accomplished great things in his life and been present during significant historic events—in each case, far exceeding what anyone imagined he could do. But despite all he has achieved, his one true love eludes him.",8.5,(1994),"Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.","(BUS APPROACHING)Hello.My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.Do you want a chocolate?I could eat abouta million and a half of these.My mama always saidlife was like a box of chocolates.You never know what you're gonna get.Those must be comfortable shoes.I'll bet you could walk all dayin shoes like that and not feel a thing.I wish I had shoes like that.My feet hurt.


Mama always said there's an awful lotyou could tell about a personby their shoes:Where they're going,where they've been.I've worn lots of shoes.I bet if I think about it real hard,I could remember my first pair of shoes.Mama said they'd take me anywhere.She said they was my magic shoes.All right, Forrest,you can open your eyes now.Let's take a little walk around.How do those feel?His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,as strong as I've ever seen,but his back is as crookedas a politician.But we're gonna straighten him right up,now, aren't we, Forrest?


Forrest!FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,Mama named me afterthe great Civil War hero,General Nathan Bedford Forrest.She said we was related to himin some way.And what he did was,he started up this club calledthe Ku Klux Klan.They'd all dress up in their robesand their bed sheetsand act like a bunch of ghostsor spooks or something.They'd even put bed sheetson their horses and ride around.And anyway, that's how I got my name,Forrest Gump.Mama said that the ""Forrest"" partwas to remind me that sometimeswe all do things that,well, just don't make no sense.(CLANG)Okay... Get it, get it...Wait, is it this way? Hold on.All right...What are you all staring at?Haven't you ever seen a little boywith braces on his legs before?Don't ever let anybody tell youthey're better than you, Forrest.If God intendedeverybody to be the same,he'd have given us all braceson our legs.FORREST: Mama always had a way ofexplaining thingsso I could understand them.We lived about a quarter mileoff Route 17,about a half mile fromthe town of Greenbow, Alabama.That's in the county of Greenbow.Our house had been in Mama's familysince her grandpa's grandpa's grandpahad come across the oceanabout 1,000 years ago,something like that.Since it was just me and Mamaand we had all these empty rooms,Mama decided to let those rooms out,mostly to people passing through,like from, oh, Mobile,Montgomery, places like that.That's how me and Mama got money.Mama was a real smart lady.Remember what I told you, Forrest.You're no different than anybody else is.Did you hear what I said, Forrest?You're the same as everybody else.You are no different.Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.Now, his IQ is 75.Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.FORREST: She wanted me to havethe finest education,so she took me tothe Greenbow County Central School.I met the principal and all.I want to show you something,Mrs. Gump.Now, this is normal.Forrest is right here.The state requires a minimum IQ of80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.He's gonna have to goto a special school.Now, he'll be just fine.What does ""normal"" mean, anyway?He might be a bit on the slow side,but my boy Forrest is gonna getthe same opportunitiesas everyone else.He's not going to some special schoolto learn how to re-tread tires.We're talking aboutfive little points here.There must be something can be done.We're a progressive school system.We don't want to see anybodyleft behind.Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?He's on vacation.(GASPING AND PANTING)Well, your mama sure does careabout your schooling, son.You don't say much, do you?(GASPING AND PANTING)""Finally, he had to try.""It looked easy, but,""oh, what happened.- ""First, there...""- Mama, what's ""vacation"" mean?- Vacation?- Where Daddy went.Vacation's when you go somewhereand you don't ever come back.FORREST: Anyway, I guess you couldsay me and Mama was on our own.But we didn't mind.Our house was never empty.There was always folkscoming and going.MRS. GUMP: Supper.- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...- My, my. That sure looks special.FORREST: Sometimes we hadso many people staying with usthat every roomwas filled with travelers.You know, folks living outof their suitcasesand hat cases and sample cases.Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...One time, a young manwas staying with us,and he had him a guitar case.(SINGING HOUND DOG)Forrest! I told you not to botherthis nice young man.ELVIS PRESLEY:Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.I was just showing him a thing or twoon the guitar here.All right, but your supper's readyif y'all want to eat.Yeah, that sounds good.Thank you, ma'am.Say, man, show me that crazylittle walk you just did there.Slow it down some.(SINGING HOUND DOG)FORREST: I liked that guitar.It sounded good.I started moving around to the music,swinging my hips.This one night,me and Mama was out shopping,and we walked right byBenson's furniture and appliance store,and guess what?(SINGING HOUND DOG)This is not for children's eyes.Some years later,that handsome young manwho they called ""The King,""well, he'd sung too many songs,had himself a heart attack,or something.Must be hard being a king.You know, it's funny how you remembersome things, but some things you can't.- You do your very best now, Forrest.- I sure will, Mama.FORREST: I remember the bus rideon the first day of school very well.Are you coming along?Mama said not to be takingrides from strangers.This is the bus to school.I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.- I'm Dorothy Harris.- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.This seat's taken.It's taken!You can't sit here.FORREST: You know, it's funny whata young man recollects,'cause I don't remember being born.I don't recall what I gotfor my first Christmas,and I don't know when I wenton my first outdoor picnic.But I do remember the first time I heardthe sweetest voice in the wide world.JENNY: You can sit here if you want.I had never seen anythingso beautiful in my life.She was like an angel.Well, are you gonna sit down,or aren't you?What's wrong with your legs?Nothing at all, thank you.My legs are just fine and dandy.I just sat next to her on that busand had a conversationall the way to school....my back's crooked likea question mark.These are going to make me...And next to Mama, no one evertalked to me or asked me questions.Are you stupid or something?Mama says, ""Stupid is as stupid does.""- I'm Jenny.- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.From that day on,we was always together.Jenny and me was likepeas and carrots.She taught me how to climb.Come on, Forrest, you can do it.I showed her how to dangle.""...a good little monkey and...""She helped me learn how to read,and I showed her how to swing.Sometimes we'd just sit outand wait for the stars.- Mama's gonna worry about me.- Just stay a little longer.For some reason,Jenny didn't never want to go home.Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.She was my most special friend.My only friend.Now, my mama always told me thatmiracles happen every day.Some people don't think so, but they do.Hey, dummy!Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?- ""Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.""- JENNY: Just run away, Forrest.Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!- Get the bikes!- BOY 1: Hurry up! Let's get him!- Come on!- Look out, dummy, here we come!We're gonna get you!Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!Come back here, you!Run, Forrest!Run!FORREST: Now, you wouldn't believe itif I told you,but I can run like the wind blows.From that day on,if I was going somewhere,I was running!BOY 1: He's getting away! Stop him!That boy sure is a running fool.Now, remember how I told you thatJenny never seemedto want to go home?Well, she lived in a housethat was as old as Alabama.Her mama had gone up to heavenwhen she was five,and her daddy wassome kind of a farmer.Jenny?He was a very loving man.He was always kissing and touchingher and her sisters.And then this one time,Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.Jenny, why didn't you cometo school today?(SHUSHES)Daddy's taking a nap.- MR. CURRAN: Jenny!- Come on!MR. CURRAN:Jenny, where'd you run to?You'd better get back here, girl!Where you at?Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?Jenny!Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.MR. CURRAN: Jenny!Dear God, make me a birdso I can fly far,far, far away from here.Dear God, make me a birdso I can fly far,far, far away from here.Mama always saidthat God is mysterious.Jenny!He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.You'd better get back here!Instead,he had the police say Jenny didn'thave to stay in that house no more.She went to live with her grandmajust over on Creekmore Avenue,which made me happy,'cause she was so close.Some nights, Jenny would sneak outand come on over to my house,just 'cause she said she was scared.Scared of what, I don't know,but I think it was her grandma's dog.He was a mean dog.Anyway, Jenny and me was best friendsall the way up through high school.- Hey, stupid!- Quit it!- Run, Forrest, run!- Hey,did you hear me, stupid?- Run, Forrest!- Come on, get in the truck!BOY 1: Get in the truck!

Go!He must be the stupidestson of a bitch alive,but he sure is fast!(ALL CHEERING)FORREST: Now, maybe it's just me,but college was very confusing times.Federal troops enforcing a court orderintegrated the Universityof Alabama today.Two negroes were admitted,but only after Governor George Wallacehad carried out his symbolic threatto stand in the school house door.KATZENBACH: Governor Wallace,I take it from that statement, that...Earl, what's going on?- Coons are trying to get into school.- Coons?When raccoons try to geton our back porch,Mama just chase them off with a broom.Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,and they want to go to school with us.With us? They do?REPORTER: Shortly after GovernorWallace had carried out his promiseto block the doorway,President Kennedyordered the Secretary of Defensethen to use military force.Here, by videotape,is the encounter by General Graham,commander of the National Guard,and Governor Wallace....because these National Guardsmenare here todayas federal soldiers for Alabamans.They live within our borders,they are all our brothers.We are winning in this fight,because we are awakeningthe American peopleto the dangers that we have spokenabout so many times,just so evident today, the trend towardsmilitary dictatorship in this country.REPORTER: And so, at day's end,the University of Alabamain Tuscaloosa had been desegregatedand students Jimmy Hoodand Vivian Malonehad been signed upfor summer classes.Ma'am, you dropped your book.Ma'am...HUNTLEY: Governor Wallace did whathe promised to do.By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,he kept the mob from gathering...Say, wasn't that Gump?- Nah, that couldn't be.- It sure as hell was.FORREST: A few years later,that angry little manat the school house doorthought it would be a good ideaand ran for president.(GUNSHOTS FIRING)But somebody thought that it wasn't.But he didn't die.My bus is here.- Is it the number nine?- No, it's the number four.It was nice talking to you.I remember when that happened,when Wallace got shot.I was in college.Did you go to a girls' college,or to a girls-and-boys-together college?It was co-ed.'Cause Jenny went to a collegeI couldn't go to.It was a college just for girls.But I'd go and visit herevery chance I got.(JENNY EXCLAIMS)That hurts.Forrest!

Who is that?- Billy, I'm sorry.- What the hell?- Just get away from me!- Don't...- Don't go!

Come on.- Is this your room?- Shh!Do you ever dream, Forrest,about who you're gonna be?- Who I'm gonna be?- Yeah.Aren't I going to be me?Well, you'll always be you,just another kind of you.You know? I want to be famous.I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.I just want to be on an empty stagewith my guitar, my voice.Just me.And I want to reach peopleon the personal level.I want to be able to say things,just one-to-one.Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?I sit next to them in my HomeEconomics class all the time.(EXCLAIMING)- I'm...

How do you feel?- I gotta pee.(CHUCKLING) I believe he saidhe had to ""go pee.""FORREST: Sometime later,for no particular reason,somebody shot thatnice young President,when he was riding in his car.And a few years after that,somebody shot his little brother, too,only he was in a hotel kitchen.It must be hard being brothers.I wouldn't know.Forrest Gump.FORREST: Now can you believe it?After only five years of playing football,I got a college degree.Congratulations, son.Mama was so proud.Forrest, I'm so proud of you.Here, I'll hold this for you.Congratulations, son.Have you given any thoughtto your future?Thought?Hello, I'm Forrest.

I'm through doing that shit.
You always say that.
The same thing every time.
""I'm through, never again,
too dangerous.""
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.
You forget about it in a day or two.
The days of me forgetting are over.
The days of me remembering
have just begun.
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?
I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack. Take heart, 'cause
you're never gonna have to hear it again.
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.
After tonight? Correct. I
got all tonight to quack.
Can I get anyone more coffee?
Oh, yes!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I mean, the way it is now,
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop
you in any way during a robbery.
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,
""We got this guy's little girl. If you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.""
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone,
not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
Did they hurt the little girl?
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.
You tell 'em empty out the register, they
don't know what you're talkin' about.
They make it too personal.
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. I'm not gonna kill anybody.
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.
And if it's not the gooks,
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.
We're out of it.
Well, what then, day jobs?
Not in this life.
What then?
Garcon, coffee!
This place.
Garcon means boy.
This place?
A coffee shop?
What's wrong with that?
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.
I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. Correct.
Same as banks,
these places are insured.
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1 .50 an hour...
really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the
next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.
See, I got the idea the last liquor
store we stuck up, remember?
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
Yes, we did. A lot of
people come to restaurants.
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?
Pretty smart.
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.
Come on. All right. Same
as last time, remember?
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.
I love you, pumpkin.
I love you, honey bunny.
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!
Any of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every motherfuckin'
last one of you.

Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
Okay, what you want to know?
Hash is legal there, right? Yeah,
it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.
I mean, they want you to smoke in your
home or certain designated places.
Those are hash bars? Yeah.
It breaks down like this.
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.
I mean, that's a right the cops in
Amsterdam don't have. Oh, man! I'm goin'.
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.
But you know what the funniest
thing about Europe is? What?
It's the little differences. I mean, they got
the same shit over there that they got here,
- but it's just there, it's a little different.
- Example.
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...
a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?
They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
Royale with Cheese.
That's right.
What do they call a Big Mac?
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.
[IMITATING FRENCH ACCENT]
Le Big Mac. [LAUGHS]
What do they call a Whopper? I don't know.
I didn't go into Burger King.
You know what they put on french fries
in Holland instead of ketchup? What?
Mayonnaise. [
Chuckles] Goddamn!
I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin'
drown 'em in that shit. Yuck.
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.
How many up there?
Three or four.
That's countin' our guy?
Not sure.
So that means that it could be up to
five guys up there? It's possible.
We should have fuckin' shotguns.
What's her name?
Mia.
Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
I don't know.
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.
Oh, really? She do
anything I'd have seen?
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
Pilot? What's a pilot?
Well, you know the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,
and on this invention they
show shows, right? Yeah.
The way they pick TV shows is they make one show.
That show's called a pilot.
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...
and on the strength of that one show, they
decide if they wanna make more shows.
Some get chosen and become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him ' ""Tony Rocky Horror.""
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right? I wouldn't
go so far as to call the brother fat.
He got a weight problem. I mean,
what's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
I think I know who you mean. What about him?
Marsellus fucked him up good.
Word 'round the campfire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
[ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
So what he'd do? Fuck her? No, no, no, no, no.
Nothin' that bad.
Well, then what then?
He gave her a foot massage.
A foot massage?
That's it?
Mm-hmm.
Then what'd Marsellus do?
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
Nigger fell through that.
Since then, he kind of developed
a speech impediment.
That's a damn shame.
Hmm.
But still, you play with matches,
you get burned. What do you mean?
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
You don't think he overreacted?
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the
way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.
It's laying your hands in a familiar
way on Marsellus's new wife.
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.
It's not. It's the same ballpark.
Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the
same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit! Have
you ever given a foot massage?
[SCOFFS] Don't be tellin'
me about foot massages.
I'm the foot fuckin' master.
You given a lot of them?
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?
Fuck you.
[CHUCKLES]
You give 'em a lot?
Fuck you.
You know, I'm kind of tired. I could
use a foot massage. Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
This is the door.
Yeah, it is.
What time you got?
7:22 in the a.m.
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no
man a foot massage don't make it right...
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,
fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks; that shit ain't right.
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a
man with a sense of humor about this shit.
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's an interestin' point.
Come on.
Let's get into character.
What's her name again?
Mia.
Mia. Why you so interested
in big man's wife?
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked
me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
Take care of her? No, man.
Just take her out.
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?
It is not a date.
It's just like if you were gonna take your
buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
It's just good company, that's all.
[SIGHS]
It's not a date. It's definitely
not a date. [SIGHS]
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?
Hey, keep chillin'.
You know who we are?
We're associates of your business
partner, Marsellus Wallace.
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.
I thought so. You remember your
business partner Marsellus Wallace,
don't ya, Brett?
Yeah, I remember.
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.
Sorry about that.
Whatcha having'?
Hamburgers.
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.
What kind of hamburgers?
Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
No, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's,
Wendy's, Jack in the Box?
Where?
Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
Big Kahuna Burger! That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I
ain't never had one myself. How are they?
They're-They're good.
You mind if I try one of yours?
This is yours here, right?
Yeah.
Mmmm.
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.
I ain't hungry. Well, if you like
burgers, give 'em a try sometime.
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?
No.
Tell 'em, Vincent.
A Royale with Cheese.
A Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?
Uh, because of
the metric system?
Check out the big brain
on Brett!
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.
What's in this?
Sprite.
Sprite. Good.
You mind if I have some of your tasty
beverage to wash this down with?
Go right ahead.

Why don't you tell my man Vince here where
you got the shit hid at. It's over...

You were sayin'?
It's in the cupboard.
N-No, the one

- Yeah, we happy.

Oh, I'm sorry, did I break

Please.
Continue. You were saying something
about ""best intentions.""
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

What?
What country you from?

like a bitch?
No! Then why you tryin' to
fuck him like a bitch, Brett?
I didn't. Yes, you did.
Yes, you did, Brett!
You tried to fuck him.
[GASPING] No, no.
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
You read the Bible, Brett?
Yes!
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.
Ezekiel 25:17.
""The path of the righteous man...
""is beset on all sides

""and the tyranny of evil men.
""Blessed is he who,

""And I will strike down upon

Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.
There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal.

Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

they would've worked in a gimmick...

I would've told another joke.

one 'cause we only did one show.

- Hmm. Hmm.
Well, that is one way to say it. Another way
to say it would be that he was thrown out.
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.
Yet, even another way is to say he was thrown
out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
Is that a fact?
No.
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.

- Did it involve the ' ""F"" word?
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.
- And?
- And-And nothin'.
That's it.
You heard Marsellus...
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story
window for giving me a foot massage?
Mm-hmm.
And you believe that?
[CHUCKLES] Well, at the time I
was told it sounded reasonable.
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.
But did it happen?
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
Really?
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

You've got a special Visitor.
[TV] Stand up. Stand up.
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?
Well, this here is Captain Koons.
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.
Hello, little man.
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...
over five years.
Hopefully...
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...
for as long as we were,
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.
If it'd been me who'd...
not made it,
Major Coolidge'd be talking
right now to my son Jim.
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.
Butch...
I got something for ya.
This watch I got here...
was first purchased by your great-grandfather
during the First World War.
It was bought in a little general
store in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.
It was bought by private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
on the day he set sail
for Paris.
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...
when he'd done his duty, he went
home to your great-grandmother,
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.
This time they called it
World War II.
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's.
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed,
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.
Your granddad was facing death.
He knew it.
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive,
so three days before
the Japanese took the island,
your granddad asked a gunner on an
Air Force transport, name of Winocki...
a man he'd never met before
in his life...
to deliver to his infant son,
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.
Three days later, your granddad was
dead, but Winocki kept his word.
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.
This watch.
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.
He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-his ass.
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.
Then he died of dysentery-
He give me the watch.
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass two years.
Then...
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...
now...
little man,
I give the watch to you.

[RING ANNOUNCER]
In the lightweight division,
in the right corner wearing
the blue trunks, [GRUNTS]
Weighing 210 pounds,
Floyd Ray Wilson!
[CROWD CHEERING, YELLING
] [BELL RINGS]
[ANNOUNCER]
It's official. It's official.
Wilson is dead! [ANNOUNCER ♪2] Well,
Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.
Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
My guess would be yes.
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.
I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
Do you feel this tragedy...
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?
A tragedy like this can't help but shake the
world of boxing to its Very foundations.
It's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain-

[MAN] Man, you know I didn't-.
Marsellus. No, it wasn't.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
How you doing?
Great.
I never thanked you for dinner.
What you got?
He booked.
His trainer? Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.
I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
No, we don't wanna ' ""think.""
We wanna know. Take him to the
kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.
Butch's search-
how do you want it done?
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a
nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...
ready to pop a cap in his ass.
I will take care of it.
Mister.
Hey, mister.
What?
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.
You're the fighter?
Whatever gave you that idea?
No, come on.
You're him.
I know you're him.
Tell me you're him.
I'm him.
You killed
the other boxing man.
He's dead?
The radio said he was dead.
Sorry about that, Floyd.
What does it feel like?
What does what feel like?
Killing a man.
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.
What are you, a weirdo?
No.
It is a subject I have
much interest in.
You are the first person I have
ever met who has killed somebody.
So?
What does it feel like to kill a man?
[SNIFFS]
I'll tell you what.
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up
there and I'll tell you all about it.
So, Esmarelda...
Villa Lobos-
is that Mexican?
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.
And what is your name?
Butch.
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda,
what is it you want to know?
I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
I couldn't tell ya.
I didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a
better boxer, he'd still be alive.
If he never laced up his gloves,
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
[HAWKS, SPITS]
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.
Yeah, well, enough about the
poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?
All eight?
How long to collect?
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
No, I understand.
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
That is great news, man.
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.
It'll probably take us a couple
days to get down to Knoxville.
Okay, my brother.
[LAUGHING] You're right.
You're goddamn right.
All right, Scotty, next time I see
you, it'll be on Tennessee time.
Cool, brother.
$45.60.
And, uh,
here's a little something
for the effort. Now...
if anybody asks you who your fare was
tonight, what are you gonna say?
The truth.
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
Buenas noches, Butch.
Whew.
Keep the light off.
Is that better, sugar pop?
Oui.
[SIREN WAILING IN
DISTANCE] [DOG BARKING]
Hard day at the office?
Pretty hard.
Got in a fight.
Poor baby.
Can you make spoons?
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.
I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
I like the way you stink.
Let me take this jacket off.
I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Uh-huh.
I wish I had a pot.
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror and you wish you had some pot?
A pot. [GIGGLES]
A pot belly.
Pot bellies are sexy.
Well, you should be happy-
[GRUNTS]
'Cause you have one.
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.
I have a bit of a tummy, like
Madonna when she did ""Lucky Star.""
It's not the same thing.
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.
The difference is huge.
[KISSING] Would you like
it if I had a pot belly?
No.
Pot bellies make a man look
either oafish or like a gorilla.
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.
The rest of you is normal-normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.
If I had one, I'd wear a
T-shirt two sizes too small...
to accentuate it.
You think men
would find that attractive?
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
is seldom the same.
[SIGHS]
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.
You'd punch me in the belly?
Right in the belly.
Ohh! I'd smother you!
I'd drop it right on your face 'til
you couldn't breathe! [LAUGHING]
You'd do that?
Yeah.
Promise?
Yeah.
[MOANING SOFTLY]
Mmm.
Mmm.
[MOANING, LAUGHING]
Oh.
[INHALING]
[GRUNTING]
Did you get everything?
Yes, I did.
Good job, sugar pop.
Did everything go as planned?
You didn't listen to the-Ow!
[GIGGLES]
You didn't listen to the radio?
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?
I won, all right.
Are you still retiring?
Sure am.
So it all worked out
in the finish.
We're not at the finish
yet, baby.
[MOANING]
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?
But they won't find us,
will they?
Do you still want me
to go with you?
I don't want to be
a burden or a nuisance. It's-
[MOANS]
Say it.
[MOANS] Fabienne,
I want you to be with me.
Forever?
Forever and ever.
Do you love me?
Very, very much.
[MOANING]
Butch.
Yes?
Will you give me oral pleasure?
Will you kiss it?
But you first.
Okay.
Okay.

My name is Fabienne!
Stop it.
Stop it!
My name is Fabi-.

Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[WATER STOPS] [BUTCH
] I take it back.
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?
Oh, I like that. I like being
called a tulip. [COUGHS]
""Tulip"" is much better
than ""mongoloid.""
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.
And I took it back.
[GRUNTS] Butch?
Yes, lemon pie?
Where are we going to go?
Well, I'm not sure yet.
Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...
that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever.
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.
If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
You betcha.
And if after a while you didn't dig
that, we could go someplace else.
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
But I do not speak Spanish.
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.
Besides, Mexican's easy.

- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.
- What was it about?
- How should I know? You were the one watching it.
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.
I don't remember.
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.
Well, let's look at the
grumpy man in the morning.
[BOTH MOANING]
[FABIENNE] Why don't you get
up and we'll get some breakfast.
One more kiss and I'll get up.
[MOANS]
Satisfied? [EXHALING] Yep.
[GRUNTS] Get up, lazy bones!
Ohh!
Ohh. God.
[GIGGLES]
What time is it?
Almost 9:00 in the morning.
What time does our train arrive?
11:00.
You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
What, lemon pie?
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...
with maple syrup,
eggs over easy
and five sausages.
Anything to drink with that?
Wow, that looks nice.
[GIGGLES]
To drink-a tall glass
of orange juice...
and a black cup of coffee.
After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
Pie for breakfast?
[LAUGHING] Any time of the
day is a good time for pie.
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.
Where's my watch?
It's there.
No, it's not.
Have you looked?
Yes, I've fuckin' looked. What
the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
You sure you got it?
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
Yeah, well, it's not here now.
[RUMMAGING] Well, it should be.
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's
not here now! So where the fuck is it?
Fabienne, where's my father's
fucking watch?
Do you have any idea what he had to
go through to get me that watch?
I don't have time to go into
it, but he went through a lot.
All this other shit you could've set on
fire, but I specifically reminded you...
not to forget the fucking watch!
Now think.
Did you get it?
I believe so.
""You believe so""? What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.
Then I did.
Are you sure?
No.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'...
[SCREAMING] [CRASH]
Do you know how fucking
stupid you fucking are?
No!
[GRUNTS]
It's not your fault.
You left it at the apartment.
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.
[EXHALING]
I reminded you about it,
but I didn't illustrate how
personal the watch was to me.
If all I gave a fuck about was the
watch, I shoulda told you that.
You're not a mind reader.
Are you?
[SNIFFLING]
I- I'm sorry.
Don't be. Just means I can't
have breakfast with you.
Why does it mean that?
Because I gotta go back to my
apartment and get my watch.
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.
If they are, and I don't
think I can handle it,
then I'll split.
I saw your watch. I thought I brought it.
I'm so sorry.
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.
Have a nice breakfast.
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say ' ""blueberry pie.""
Blueberry pie.
Maybe not that fast.
But pretty fast. Okay? Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,
she forgets my father's watch!
I specifically reminded her-
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.
I said the words:
""Don't forget my father's watch.""

Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...
with a goddamn hand cannon?
You see the size of that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.
We should be fuckin' dead, man.
I know.
We was lucky.
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.
You know what
divine intervention is?
I think so.
That means that God came down from
heaven and stopped the bullets.
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.
God came down from heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
- What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.
Wrong! Wrong. This shit
doesn't ""just happen.""
Do you want to continue this
theological discussion in a car...
or in a jailhouse with the cops?
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!
What happened here was a miracle, and
I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.
[VINCENT]
You ever seen that show Cops?
I was watching it one time
and there was this cop on,
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened.
He didn't hit nothin'.
Okay? It was just him and this guy.
I mean, you know,
it's-it's freaky, but it happens.
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the
shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.
Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
Don't blaspheme.
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?
Look, I'm tellin'
Marsellus today-I'm through.
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.
[SIGHS]
Marvin, what do you make of all this?
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from heaven and stopped...
- [GUNSHOT]
- What the fuck's happenin'?
Aw, shit, man!
Aw, man!
Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
Why the fuck'd you do that?
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.
Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in
my time, but this-Chill out, man!
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a
city street in broad daylight here!
I don't believe it! Well,
believe it now, motherfucker!
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!
This is the Valley, Vincent.
Marsellus ain't got no
friendly places in the Valley.
Well, Jules, this ain't my
fuckin' town, man! Shit!
What you doing? I'm calling
my partner in Toluca Lake.
Where's Toluca Lake? Over the
hill here, by Burbank Studios.
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't
know what the fuck we gonna do,
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and
we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.
He's one remark away from
kickin' our asses out the door.
If he does, what do we do? We ain't
leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-Jimmie's a friend.
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.
Just tell him
not to be abusive.
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.
Put yourself in his position-It's
8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.
He wasn't expectin' this shit.
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do
to his towel, man? I was dryin' my hands!
You're supposed to wash 'em first!
You watched me wash 'em.
I watched you get 'em wet. I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,
and when I finished, the towel didn't
look like no goddamn maxi-pad!
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?
It's shit like this that's gonna
bring this situation to a head, man!
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?
All right.
Fine. Fine.
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.
Mmm!
Goddamn, Jimmie!
This some serious gourmet shit.
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.
Right?
[CHUCKLES]
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.
- What? - I don't need you to tell
me how fuckin' good my coffee is.
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.
- Jimmie, don't even worry-
- Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.
When you came pulling in here,
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, ""Dead nigger storage""?
- You know I ain't seen no-
- Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...
that said,
""Dead nigger storage""?
No. I didn't.
You know why you didn't see that sign?
[SIGHS] Why?
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-
- Don't you fuckin' realize...
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?
No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.
Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me, Jules! Okay?
Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me.
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget I love my wife. Is there?
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.
The graveyard shift at the hospital.
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.
That's Kool and the Gang. We
don't wanna fuck your shit up.
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.
You're fucking my shit up
right now!
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.
Well, say she comes home.
What do you think she'll do?
Oh, no fuckin' shit
she'll freak.
That ain't no kinda answer.
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...
this Bonnie situation is.
She comes home from a hard day's work, finds
a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...
doing a bunch of gangster shit,
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.
[ALL GASPING]
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!
All I want to hear from your ass is, ""You ain't
got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.""
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly.""
You ain't got
no problem, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker.
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
Wolf, who should be coming directly.
You sendin' the Wolf?
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?
Shit, yeah, negro!
That's all you had to say!

Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
It's 30 minutes away.
I'll be there in 10.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
[DOORBELL RINGS]
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?
It sure is. I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.
Good. We got one. So I heard.
May I come in?
Uh, yeah. Please do.
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking.
Is that right, Jimmie?
Uh, one hundred percent.
Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30
in the a.m., correct? Uh-huh.
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds
us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.
She wouldn't at that. That gives us 40
minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,
which, if you do what I say, when
I say it, should be plenty.
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus
a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
[SIGHS]
Jimmie.
Uh-huh.
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.
Would you make me a cup?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
Positive?
Don't get me on the road and I find
out the brake lights don't work.
As far as I know, the motherfucker's
tip-top. Good enough.
Let's go back to the kitchen.
[EXHALES]
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
Thank you, Jimmie.
Mmm.
Okay, first thing.
You two.
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.
That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. Yeah. Under the sink.
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products...
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those
little pieces of brain and skull.
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.
We need to raid
your linen closet.
I need blankets, I need
comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
The thicker the better, the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.
We'll need to camouflage the front
seat and back seat and floorboards...
with quilts and blankets,
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.
""Please"" would be nice.
- Come again?
- I said, a ""please"" would be nice.
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean
disrespect, okay? I respect you.
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.
So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.
Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right?
I can feel your look.
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
[SIPPING]
Green.
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.
Mmm, about 20 minutes.
Nobody who'll be missed.
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.
How we comin', Jimmie?
Pretty good.
I got it all here, but, uh,
[SIGHS]
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
Okay. You gotta understand
something, uh, Winston.
Uh-Uh, no, thank you.
Uh, this is our
best linen here,
and it's, uh-
it was a wedding present...
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.
They're not with us anymore. I wanna
help-Let me ask you a question.
If you don't mind. No, no, please.
Go ahead.
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt
ginny, were they millionaires?
No.
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
Ginny.
Ginny were here,
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.
How about you, Jimmie?
You an oak man?
Oak's nice.
Oh, man, I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong,
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...
on account of your dumb ass. I got a threshold,
Jules, for the abuse that I will take.
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
That's all. I could blow.
Oh, you ready to blow?
Yeah.
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

am I doin' in the back?

We're fuckin' switchin'!

pickin' up this nigger's skull!
Fine job, gentlemen.
You may get out of this yet.
I can't believe
this is the same car.
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.
Phase one is complete-clean the car-which
moves us right along to phase two:
clean you two.
Strip.
All the way? [WOLF]
To your bare ass.
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?
You know what you two look like?
[VINCENT] What?
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.
Toss 'em in Jimmie's
garbage bag.
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this
shit out front for the garbage man to pick up.
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.
Vincent. [WOLF]
Okay, gentlemen.
You both been to county
before, I'm sure. Here it comes.
Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Better you than me, gentlemen.
[CHUCKLING]
Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.
[YELLING CONTINUES]
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!
- Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um-.
Towel.
[WOLF] You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.
[WOLF LAUGHING] Perfect.
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.
You guys look like-.
What do they look like, Jimmie?
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
[LAUGHING]
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing
our way right into prison.
Don't make me beg.
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our
rules of the road straight.
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood,
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.
Now, if we come across the
path of any John Q. Laws,
nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something. Right.
What did I say?
Don't do shit unless.
Unless what?
Unless you do it first.
Spoken like a true prodigy.
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep
your spurs from jingling and jangling?
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool, I promise you.
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it,
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.
[METAL DOOR SLAMMING]
[ENGINE IDLING]
Outta my way, Rex.
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.
- [VINCENT] All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.
Someday all this will be hers.
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
You guys going to a volleyball
game or something? [WOLF LAUGHS]
I'm takin' milady
out to breakfast.
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?
Redondo.
Inglewood.
It's-
It's your future. I...
I see a-a cab ride.
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.
Good night, Raquel. I'll
see you guys around.
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.
Yeah, really. And thank
you very much, Mr. Wolf.
Call me Winston.
You see that, young lady? Respect.
[ALARM DEACTIVATES]
Respect for one's elders shows character.
I have character.
Because you are a character doesn't mean
that you have character. [CHUCKLES]
[TIRES SCREECHING]
Wanna share a cab?
I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin'
breakfast with me? [PHONE DIALING]
Cool.
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.
Yeah, he's about as European as
fuckin' English Bob. I know that now.
But was he cool or what?
Thank you.
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
[CHUCKLES] Want some bacon?
No, man, I don't eat pork.
Are you Jewish? I ain't Jewish; I
just don't dig on swine, that's all.
Why not?
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie, but I'd never know...
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense
enough to disregard its own feces.
How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.
I don't eat dog either.
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,
but they're definitely dirty.
But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.
Ah, so, by that rationale,
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.
Is that true? We'd have to be talkin'
about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Oh, man, that's good.
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.
I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
About what?
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?
Act of God.
And what's an act of God?
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.
But this morning...
I don't think qualifies.
Hey, Vincent.
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
You don't judge shit
like this based on merit.
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...
was an According-to-Hoyle
miracle is insignificant.
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.
God got involved.
But why?
Well, that's what's fuckin'
with me: I don't know why.
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
For life? Most definitely. Yeah.
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the earth.
- What you mean, ""Walk the earth""?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.
And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?
- 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
- What if he don't do that?
- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.
They got a name for that, Jules-
It's called a bum.
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.
Garcon! Coffee!
Jules, look, what happened this
morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.
- But water into wine, I-
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,
then you should cease
asking scary questions.
I'm gonna take a shit.
Let me ask you something.
When did you make this decision, when you
were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin'
my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,
replayin' the incident
in my head,
when I had what alcoholics refer
to as a moment of clarity.

[GIGGLING]
Goddamn it, what is it?
You let him go!
You let him go!
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.
Say, ""Bitch, be cool!"" Say,
""Bitch, be cool!"" Be cool! Be cool!
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
Chill out, honey bunny!
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!
Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
I promise!
Tell her to chill!
Chill out, honey bunny!
Now tell me her name.
Yolanda.
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.
And what's Fonzie like?
Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
He's cool.
What?
Cool.
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.
And when I count three,
I want you to
let go of your gun,
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.
And when you do it,
you do it cool.
You ready?
One,
two,
three.
[PANTING] Okay, now you let him go!
Yolanda!
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
When I get nervous,
I get scared.
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.
Well, that seems to be
the situation.
But I don't want that.
And you don't want that.
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
Now...
here's the situation.
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.
Besides, I been through too much
shit over this case this morning...
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.
- Vincent!
- [YELLS]
Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
Get back!
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.
Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.
[YOLANDA WHIMPERING]
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...
and don't do a goddamn thing.
Tell her it's still cool.
It's still cool, honey bunny.
How we doin', baby?
I- I gotta go pee.
I wanna go home.
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.
I love you too, honey bunny.
Now,
I want you to go in that
bag and find my wallet.
Which one is it? It's the one
that says ""bad motherfucker.""
That's it. That's my
bad motherfucker.
Open it up.
Take out the money.
[JULES] Count it.
How much is there?
About 1,500 dollars.
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.
Now, with the rest of those
wallets and the register,
that makes this a pretty
successful little score, huh?
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
Vince, shut the fuck up!
Shut up! Come on, Yolanda.
Stay with me, baby.
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.
I'm buyin' something
for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
What?
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.
You read the Bible, Ringo?
Not regularly, no.
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17.
""The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...
""by the inequities of the selfish...
""and the tyranny of evil men.
""Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will,
""shepherds the weak
through the Valley of darkness,
""for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.
""And I will strike down upon thee with
great Vengeance and furious anger...
""those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.
""And you will know
I am the Lord...
when I lay my vengeance
upon you.""
I been sayin' that shit
for years,
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...
before I popped a cap
in his ass.
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.
Or it could mean...
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.
Yeah, I'd like that.
But that shit ain't the truth.
The truth is,
you're the weak...
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
But I'm tryin', Ringo.
I'm tryin' real hard...
to be the shepherd.
Go.
I think we should be
leaving now.

2,The Shining,"Jack Torrance accepts a caretaker job at the Overlook Hotel, where he, along with his wife Wendy and their son Danny, must live isolated from the rest of the world for the winter. But they aren't prepared for the madness that lurks within.",8.4,(1980),"Signing a contract, Jack Torrance, a normal writer and former teacher agrees to take care of a hotel which has a long, violent past that puts everyone in the hotel in a nervous situation. While Jack slowly gets more violent and angry of his life, his son, Danny, tries to use a special talent, the ""Shining"", to inform the people outside about whatever that is going on in the hotel.","Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.My name is Jack Torrance.His office is the first door on the left.Thank you.[KNOCKS]- Mr. Ullman?- Yes.- I'm Jack Torrance.- Oh, come on in, Jack.- Very nice to meet you.- Nice to meet you.- This is my secretary, Susie.- Hello.- Susie, how do you do?- Any trouble finding us?No problem at all. I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.


That's very good time.Sit down a minute, Jack.Just make yourself at home.Like some coffee?If you're having some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.- Susie.- Sure.And ask Bill Watson to join us.Yes, I will.[MUSIC PLAYS ON TV]Mom?Yeah?Do you really want to go and livein that hotel for the winter?Sure I do.It'll be lots of fun.


Yeah. I guess so.Anyway, there's hardly anybodyto play with around here.I know. It always takesa little time to make new friends.Yeah, I guess so.What about Tony?He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.[IN TONY'S VOICE] No, lain 't, Mrs. Torrance.Now, come on, Tony. Don't be silly.I don't want to go there.How come you don't want to go?I just don't.Did they give you any idea in Denver......about what the job entails?Only in a very general way.Well......the winters can be fantastically cruel.The basic idea is to copewith the very costly damage......and depreciation which can occur.This consists mainly of running the boiler......heating different parts of thehotel on a daily rotating basis......repairing damage as it occurs......and doing repairs so theelements can't get a foothold.That sounds fine to me.Physically, it's not a very demanding job.The only thing that can get a bittrying here during the winter......is a tremendous sense of isolation.That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.I'm outlining a new writing project.Five months of peace is just what I want.That's very good, Jack.Because, for some people......solitude......and isolation......can, of itself, become a problem.Not for me.How about your wife and son?Do you think they'll take to it?They'll love it.Great.Well, before I turn you over to Bill......there's one other thing I thinkwe should talk about.Not to sound melodramatic......but it's been known to give a few people......second thoughts about the job.I'm intrigued.I don't suppose they said anything in Denver......about the tragedy we had up hereduring the winter of 1970.I don't believe they did.ULLMAN: Well...My predecessor in this job......hired a man named Charles Gradyas the winter caretaker.He came up with his wife andtwo little girls of about 8 and 10.He had a good employment record, good references.And from what I've been told, he seemed......like a completely normal individual.But at some point during the winter......he must have suffered some kindof a complete mental breakdown.He ran amuck......and killed his family with an ax.Stacked them neatly in a roomin the west wing, and then......he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.The police thought......that it was what the old-timersused to call cabin fever.A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur......when people are shut in togetherover long periods of time.Wow.That is......quite a story.Yeah, it is.It's still hard for me to believeit actually happened here.But it did.And, uh......I think you can appreciatewhy I wanted to tell you about it.I certainly can.I also understand why your people in Denver......left it for you to tell me.Obviously, some people can be put off......from staying in a place wheresomething like that happened.You can rest assured that's notgoing to happen with me.And as far as my wife is concerned......I'm sure she'll be absolutelyfascinated when I tell her.She's a confirmed ghost story......and horror film addict.Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?He already did.He's going to phone Wendy upin a few minutes to tell her.[PHONE RINGING]Hello.- Hi, babe.- Hi, hon. How's it going?Great. I'm at the hotel andI still have a lot to go through.I don't think I can get home before 9:00 or 10:00.Sounds like you got the job.Right. It's a beautiful place.You and Danny are going to love it.Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?I don't know.You do too know. Now come on, tell me.I don't want to.Please.No.Now, Tony, tell me.BOY-We must really be high up.The air feels so different.Mm-hm.Dad?Yes?I'm hungry-You should've eaten your breakfast.We'll get you somethingas soon as we get to the hotel.Okay, Mom.Wasn't it around here thatthe Donner party got snowbound?I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.Oh.What was the Donner party?They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.They had to resort to cannibalismin order to stay alive.You mean they ate each other up?They had to in order to survive.Jack.Don't worry, Mom.I know all about cannibalism. I saw it on TV.See, it's okay.He saw it on the television.- What time does the plane leave?- 8:30.That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.- Bye.Good morning. I hope youhaven't been waiting too long.No problem. We had time to grab a bite to eat.Good. Glad you made itbefore they shut down the kitchen.- Hi.- Is your family having a look around?No, my son's discovered the games room.- Has your luggage been brought in?- Right there.Oh, fine.In view of all we have to cover today......I suggest we have a quick lookat your apartment and get started.Have the Torrances' thingsbrought to their apartment.- Fine.- I'd better collect my family first.Oh, yes.This is our Colorado Lounge.It's beautiful.My God!This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?It sure is.This is the staff wing of the hotel.None of the other bedroomsare heated during the winter.- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.- Goodbye, girls.ULLMAN: And here are your quarters.Living room, bedroom, bathroom.And a small bedroom for your son.Perfect for a child.- Yeah.- Yes.WENDY: When was the Overlook built?Construction started in 1907.It was finished in 1909.The site's supposed to be on an Indian burial ground.They actually had to repel......a few Indian attacks as they were building it.That's our Snowcat.Can you both drive a car?BOTH: Yes.ULLMAN: That's fine. Basicallythe Snowcat operates very much like a car.It won't take you long to get the hang of it.This is the kitchen, huh?This is it.How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.This whole place is such an enormous maze.I'll have to leave a trail ofbreadcrumbs every time I come in.Don't let it get you down.It's big, but it ain't nothing but a kitchen.A lot of this stuff you'll never have to touch.I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.One thing for sure, you don'thave to worry about food.You folks could eat here for a yearand never have the same menu twice.Right here is our walk-in freezer.This is where we keep all of our meat.You got 15 rib roasts......30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens......50 sirloin steaks, two dozen of pork roast......and 20 legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc?- No.- You don't?What's your favorite food, then?French fries and ketchup.I think we can manage that too, Doc.Come along, now. Watch your step.Mr. Hallorann......how'd you know we call him Doc?- Beg your pardon?- Doc. You called Danny ""Doc"" twice.- I did?- Yeah.We call him Doc sometimes,like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.But how did you know?I guess I probably heard you call him that.It's possible. But I honestly don't remember......calling him that since we've been with you.Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he?[IMITATES BUGS BUNNY] Eh, what's up, Doc?Now, this is the storeroom.In here is where we keep......all the dried goods and the canned goods.We got canned fruits and vegetables......canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs......Rice Krispies, oatmeal,Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.We got 60 boxes of dried milk...[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]DICK'S VOICE: How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?DICK: Sociables, finger rolls......and 7 kinds of what have you.Now, we've got dried peaches, dried apricots......dried raisins and dried prunes.You know, you got to keep regularif you want to be happy.- Hi. WENDY: Hi.- How're you getting on?- Fine.Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?We're on our way to the basement.I promise we won't keep her very long.No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was justgetting to the ice cream.- You like ice cream, Doc?- Yeah.I thought you did.You folks mind if I give Dannysome ice cream while we wait?- Not at all.- We don't mind.- Good.- Sound good to you, Doc?- DANNY: Yeah.- Okay, you behave yourself.What kind of ice cream do you like?Chocolate.Chocolate it shall be. Come on, son.It's amazing, all this activity today.The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the......last day's always hectic.Everybody wants to be on their wayas early as possible.By 5:00 tonight, you'll neverknow anybody was ever here.- WENDY: Just like a ghost ship, huh?- Yes.Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?You know what I'm talking about, don't you?I can remember when I was a little boy......my grandmother and I could hold conversations......entirely without ever opening our mouths.She called it ""shining.""And for a long time I thoughtit was just the two of us......that had ""the shine"" to us.Just like you probably thought you was the only one.But there are other folks......though mostly they don'tknow it, or don't believe it.How long have you been able to do it?Why don't you want to talk about it?I'm not supposed to.Who says you ain't supposed to?Tony.Who's Tony?Tony's the little boy that lives in my mouth.Is Tony the one that......tells you things?Yes.How does he tell you things?It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things.But when I wake up, I can't remember everything.Does your mom and dad know about Tony?Yes.Do they know he tells you things?Tony told me never to tell them.Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?About the Overlook Hotel?I don't know.Now think real hard, Doc.Think.Is there something bad here?Well......you know, Doc, when something happens......it can leave a trace of itself behind.Say, like......if someone burns toast.Well...Maybe things that happenleave other kind of traces behind.Not things that anyone can notice.But things that people who shine can see.Just like they can see thingsthat haven't happened yet......well......sometimes they can see thingsthat happened a long time ago.I think a lot of things happened right here......in this particular hotel over the years.And not all of them was good.What about room 237?Room 237?You're scared of room 237, ain't you?No, I ain't.Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?Nothing.There ain't nothing in room 237.But you ain't got no business going in there anyway.So stay out.You understand? Stay out![WOLF HOWLS]Good morning, hon.Your breakfast is ready.What time is it?It's about 11:30.Eleven-thirty, Jesus.I guess we've been staying up too late.I know it.I made them just the wayyou like them, sunny-side up.Nice.It's really pretty outside.How about taking me for a walkafter you finish your breakfast?I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.Any ideas yet?Lots of ideas.No good ones.Something will come.It's just a matter of settling intothe habit of writing every day.Yep. That's all it is.[THUDDING]- All right.- And you're going to lose.And I'm going to get you. You'd better run fast![WENDY HUMS]Look out!I'm coming in close.DANNY: Loser has to keep America clean.WENDY: Oh, no! DANNY: Keep America clean.Okay. Danny, you win.Let's take the rest of this walking.- Okay.- Whew.Give me your hand.Isn't it beautiful?Yeah.DANNY: Dead end.WENDY: Woo, we made it.- Isn't it beautiful? DANNY: Yeah.It's so pretty.Yeah.I didn't think it was going to be this big. Did you?Nope.[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING]Hi, hon.How's it going?Fine.Get a lot written today?Yes.Hey, the weather forecastsaid it's going to snow tonight.What do you want me to do about it?Come on, hon.Don't be so grouchy.I'm not......being grouchy-I just want to finish my work.Okay. I understand.I'll come back later with a couple of sandwiches.Maybe you'll let me read something then.Wendy......let me explain something to you.When you come in and interrupt,you're breaking my concentration.You're distracting me......and it will then take me timeto get back to where I was.Understand?Yeah.Fine.We're going to make a new rule:Whenever I'm in here......and you hear me typing...[PUNCHES KEYS]...or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here......when I'm in here, that means I am working.That means don't come in.Now, do you think you can handle that?Yeah.Fine.Why don't you start right nowand get the fuck out of here?Okay.DANNY: Missed!DANNY: Don't have!No fair anymore.[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING]Oh, no.I knew it.This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.KDK12 to KDK 1.This is KDK 1.

3,Fight Club,"A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.",8.2,(1999),"A nameless first person narrator (Edward Norton) attends support groups in attempt to subdue his emotional state and relieve his insomniac state. When he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another fake attendee of support groups, his life seems to become a little more bearable. However when he associates himself with Tyler (Brad Pitt) he is dragged into an underground fight club and soap making scheme. Together the two men spiral out of control and engage in competitive rivalry for love and power. When the narrator is exposed to the hidden agenda of Tyler's fight club, he must accept the awful truth that Tyler may not be who he says he is.","People are always asking meif I know Tyler Durden.Three minutes.This is it. Ground zero.Would you like to say a few words for the occasion?With a gun barrel between your teeth,you speak only in vowels.I can't think of anything.For a second, totally I forget aboutTyler's controlled demolition thingand I wonder how clean that gun is.It's getting exciting now.That old saying,how you always hurt the one you love,well, it works both ways.


We have front-row seatsfor this theatre of mass destruction.The Demolitions Committeeof Project Mayhemwrapped the foundation columnsof a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.In two minutes,primary charges will blow base chargesand a few square blocks will be reducedto smouldering rubble.I know this because Tyler knows this.Two and a half.Think of everything we've accomplished.Suddenly I realize that all of this,the gun, the bombs, the revolution,has got something to dowith a girl named Marla Singer.Bob. Bob had bitch tits.This was a support groupfor men with testicular cancer.The big moosie slobbering all over me,that was Bob.We're still men.Yes, we're men.


Men is what we are.Eight months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.Then hormone therapy.He developed bitch tits'cause his testosterone was too highand his body upped the oestrogen.That was where I fit.I think they're gonna have to open upmy pecs again and drain the fluid.Between those huge, sweating titsthat hung enormous,the way you'd think of God's as big.Okay , you cry now.No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.For six months, I couldn't sleep.I couldn't sleep...With insomnia, nothing's real.Everything's far away.Everything's a copy of a copyof a copy.When deep-space exploration ramps up,it'll be the corporationsthat name everything.The IBM Stellar Sphere.The Microsoft Galaxy.The Planet Starbucks.I need you out of town a little more this week.We've got some red flags to cover.It must have been Tuesday.He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.You want me to deprioritise my reportsuntil you advise of a status upgrade?Make these your primary action items. Here's your flightcoupons. Call me from the road if there's any snags.He was full of pep.Must have had his grande latte enema.Like so many others, I had becomea slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.- Yes. I'd like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.- Please hold.If I saw something clever,like a little coffee tablein the shape of a yin-yang,I had to have it.The Klipsk personal office unit.The Hovetrekke home Exerbike.Or the Ohamshab sofawith the Strinne green stripe pattern.Even the Ryslampa wire lamps ofenvironmentally friendly unbleached paper.I'd flip through catalogues and wonder:What kind of dining setdefines me as a person?I had it all. Even the glass disheswith tiny bubbles and imperfections,proof that they werecrafted by the honest,hard-working, indigenous peoples of...- Please hold.- ...wherever.- I was holding.- Your call is important to us.We used to read pornography.Now it was the Horchow collection.- No. You can't die from insomnia.- What about narcolepsy?I nod off, I wake up in strange places.I have no idea how I got there.- You need to lighten up.- Can you please just give me something?Red and blue Tuinals,lipstick-red Seconals...No. You need healthy, natural sleep.Chew some valerian rootand get more exercise.- Hey, come on. I'm in pain.- You wanna see pain?Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.See the guys with testicular cancer.That's pain.I always wanted three kids.Two boys and a girl.Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.We never could agree on anything.Well, she had her first child last week.A girl.With her... with her new husband.And thank God. You know?I-I'm glad for her.Because she deserves it.Everyone, let's thank Thomasfor sharing himself with us.Thank you, Thomas.I look around this room,and I see a lot of courage.And that gives me strength.We give each other strength.It's time for the one-on-ones.So let's all of us follow Thomas' good exampleand really open ourselves up.Could you find a partner?And this is how I met the big moosie.His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.Knees together.Those awkward little steps.- My name is Bob.- Bob?Bob had been a champion body builder.You know that chest expansionprogram you see on late-night TV?That was his idea.I was a juicer.You know - using steroids.Diabonal and... Wisterol.Oh, they use that on racehorses,for Christ's sakes.And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,my two grown kidswon't even return my phone calls.Strangers with this kind of honestymake me go a big, rubbery one.Go ahead... Cornelius.You can cry.And then... something happened.I let go.That's really good.Lost in oblivion.Dark and silent and complete.I found freedom.Losing all hope was freedom.It's okay.Babies don't sleep this well.I became addicted.If I didn't say anything,people always assumed the worst.They cried harder...then I cried harder.Now we're going to open the green door,the heart chakra...I wasn't really dying.I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.I was the warm little centrethat the life of this world crowded around.Imagine your painas a white ball of healing light.It moves over your body, healing you.Now keep this going.Remember to breathe.And step forwardthrough the back door of the room.Where does it lead?To your cave.Step forward into your cave.That's right.You're going deeper into your cave,and you're going to findyour power animal.Slide.Every evening I died.And every evening I was born again.Resurrected.Bob loved me because he thoughtmy testicles were removed too.Being there, pressed against his tits,ready to cry.This was my vacation.And she... ruined everything.This is cancer, right?This chick, Marla Singer,did not have testicular cancer.She was a liar.She had no diseases at all.I had seen her at Free and Clear,my blood parasites group, Thursdays.Then at Hope,my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.And again at Seize the Day,my tuberculosis, Friday night.Marla, the big tourist.Her lie reflected my lie.And suddenly, I felt nothing.I couldn't cry.So once again, I couldn't sleep.Next group, after guided meditation,after we open our heart chakras,when it's time to hug,I'm gonna grab that bitch Marla Singerand scream:Marla, you liar!You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!I hadn't slept in four days.We'll just let that dry...When you have insomnia,you're never really asleepand you're never really awake.To begin tonight's communion,Chloe would like to say a few words.Oh, yeah. Chloe.Chloe looked the wayMeryl Streep's skeleton would lookif you made it smile and walk around aparty being extra nice to everybody.Well, I'm still here.But I don't know for how long.That's as much certaintyas anyone can give me.But I've got some good news.I no longer have any fear of death.But... I am in a pretty lonely place.No one will have sex with me.I'm so close to the end,and all I want is to get laid forthe last time.I have pornographic moviesin my apartment,- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.- Thank you, Chloe.Everyone, let's thank Chloe.Thank you, Chloe.Now, let's ready ourselffor guided meditation.You're standing at the entranceof your cave.You step inside your cave and you walk...if I did have a tumour, I'd name it Marla.Marla.The scratch on the roof of your mouththat would heal if you could stoptonguing it, but you can't....deeper into your cave as you walk.You feel the healing energy ofthis place all around you.Now find your power animal.Slide.Okay. Let's partner up.Pick someone special to you tonight.Hey.- We need to talk.- Sure.- I'm onto you.- What?Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.Sorry?In the Tibetan-philosophy,Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.All right, but you're not dyingthe way Chloe back there is dying.So?So you're a tourist.I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,I saw you at tuberculosis.I saw you at testicular cancer!I saw you practising this.- Practising what?- Telling me off.Is it going as well as you hoped...""Rupert""?- I'll expose you.- Go ahead. I'll expose you.All right, come together. Let yourselves cry.Oh, God. Why are you doing this?It's cheaper than a movieand there's free coffee's.Look, this is important.These are my groups.I've been coming for over a year.- Why do you do it?- I don't know.When people think you're dying, then theyreally really listen to you instead of just...Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.Yeah. Yeah.Share yourself, completely.Look, you don't want to get into this.It becomes an addiction.- Really?- I'm not kidding.I can't cry if another faker is present,and I need this.So you gotta find somewhere else to go.Candy-stripe a cancer ward.It's not my problem.Wait a second. Hold on. I'll tell you.We're gonna split up the week, okay?You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.You take tuberculosis.My smoking doesn't go over at all.Okay. Good. Fine.Testicular cancer should be no contest.Technically, I have more right to be there than you.You still have your balls.- You're kidding.- I dunno. Am I?No. No.- What do you want?- I'll take the parasites.You can't have both the parasites, butwhy don't you take the blood parasites.I want brain parasites.I'll take the blood parasites,but I'm gonna take the organic brain dementia.- I want that.- You can't have the whole brain.So far, you have four. I only have two.Okay. Take both the parasites. They're yours.Now we both have three...Hey! You left half your clothes.- What, are you selling those?- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.So, we each have three. That's six.What about the seventh day?I want ascending bowel cancer.The girl had done her homework.- No. No. I want bowel cancer.- That's your favourite too?- Tried to slip it by me, eh?- Look, we're gonna split it.Take the first and third Sundayof the month.Deal.- Looks like this is goodbye.- Well, let's not make a big thing out of it, okay.How's this for not making a big thing?Hey, Marla! Marla!- Maybe we should exchange numbers.- Should we?We might wanna switch nights.Okay.This is how I met Marla Singer.Marla's philosophy of lifeis that she might die at any moment.The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.It doesn't have your name! Who are you?Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?Any of the stupid namesyou give each night?You wake up at SeaTac.SFO. LAX.You wake up at O'Hare.Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.Pacific. Mountain. Central.Lose an hour. Gain an hour.Check-in for that flightdoesn't begin for another two hours, sir.This is your life,and it's ending one minute at a time.You wake up at Air Harbour International.If you wake up at a different time,in a different place,could you wake up as a different person?Everywhere I travel, tiny life.Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream,single pat of butter.The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.Shampoo-conditioner combos. Samplepackage mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.The people I meet on each flight,they're single-serving friends.Between take-off and landing, we haveour time together, but that's all we get.Welcome!On a long-enough time line,the survival rate foreveryone drops to zero.I was a recall coordinator.My job was to apply the formula.The infant went through the windshield.Three points.A new car built by my companyleaves somewhere travelling at 60mph.The rear differential locks up.The teenager's bracesare wrapped around the back-seat ashtray.Might make a good anti-smoking ad.The car crashes and burnswith everyone trapped inside.Now, should we initiate a recall?The father must've been huge.See where the fat's burned to the seat?The polyester shirt?Very modern art.Take the number ofvehicles in the field, A.Multiply it by the probable rateof failure, B.Then multiply the result bythe average out-of-court settlement, C.A x B x C...equals X.If X is less than the cost of a recall,we don't do one.Are there a lot of thesekinds of accidents?You wouldn't believe.Which car company do you work for?A major one.Every time the plane banked too sharplyon take-off or landing,I prayed for a crashor a mid-air collision.Anything.Life insurance pays off tripleif you die on a business trip.""If you are seatedin an emergency exit row""and feel you would be unable or unwilling toperform the duties listed on the safety card,""please ask a flight attendantto reseat you.""- it's a lot of responsibility.- Wanna switch seats?No. I'm not sureI'm the man for that particular job.An exit-door procedureat 30,000 feet.The illusion of safety.Yeah. I guess so.You know whythey put oxygen masks on planes?- So you can breathe.- Oxygen gets you high.In a catastrophic emergency,you're taking giant panic breaths.Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.You accept your fate.It's all right here.Emergency water landing, 600mph.Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.That's...That's an interesting theory.- What do you do?- What do you mean?What do you do for a living?Why? So you can pretendlikeyou're interested?Okay.You have a kind ofsick desperation in your laugh.We have the exact same briefcase.Soap.- Sorry?- I make and I sell soap.The yardstick of civilization.And this is how I met...""Tyler Durden"".Did you know if you mixed equal parts of gasolineand frozen orange juice concentrate,you can make napalm?- No, I did not know that. Is that true?- That's right.One can make all kinds of explosivesusing simple household items.- Really?- If one were so inclined.Tyler, you are by far the most interestingsingle-serving friend I've ever met.- See, everything on a plane is single-serving...- Oh, I get it. Very clever.Thank you.How's that working out for you?- What?- Being clever.- Great.- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.Now, a question of etiquette.As I pass,do I give you the ass or the crotch?How I came to live with Tyler is...Airlines have this policyabout vibrating luggage.Was it ticking?Actually, throwers don't worry aboutticking because modern bombs don't tick.- Sorry. Throwers?- Baggage handlers.But when a suitcase vibrates,then the throwers got to call the police.My suitcase was vibrating?Nine times out of ten it's an electricrazor, but... every once in a while...it's a dildo.Of course it's company policy never to implyownership in the event of a dildo.We have to use the indefinite article -""a dildo"", never ""your dildo"".I don't own...I had everything in that suitcase.My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.Never mind.Hey! That's my car!Home was a condo onthe 15th floor of a filing cabinetfor widows and young professionals.The walls were solid concrete.A foot of concrete's importantwhen your next-door neighbourhas to watch game shows at full volume.Or when a blast of debristhat used to be your personal effectsblows out of your floor to ceiling windowsand sails flaming into the night.I suppose these things happen.There's... nothing up there.You can't go into the unit. Police orders.Do you have somebody you can call?How embarrassing.A houseful of condiments and no food.The police would later tell me that the pilot lightmight have gone out,letting out just a little bit of gas.That gas could haveslowly filled the condo,1700 square feet with high ceilings,for days and days.Then the refrigerator's compressorcould have clicked on.Yeah?I can hear you breathing, you...if you ask me now,I couldn't tell you why I called him.- Hello?- Who's this?- Tyler?- Who is this?Um...We met... We met on the airplane.We had the same suitcase?- Uh... the clever guy.- Oh, yeah. Right.I called a second ago.There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.Yeah, I *69'd you.I never pick up my phone.So what's up?Well...You're not gonna believe this.You know man, it could be worse.A woman could cut off your penis while you sleepand toss it out the window of a moving car.There's always that.It's just, when you buy furniture,you tell yourself:That's it. That's the last sofa I'll need.Whatever else happens,I've got that sofa problem handled.I had it all.I had a stereo that was very decent.A wardrobe that wasgetting very respectable.I was close to being complete.- Shit, man. And now it's all gone.- All gone.All gone.Do you know what a duvet is?- It's a comforter.- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?Is this essential to our survivalin the hunter-gatherer sense of the word?No.- What are we, then?- I dunno. Consumers.Right. We're consumers.We are by-products ofa lifestyle obsession.Murder, crime, poverty.These things don't concern me.What concerns meare celebrity magazines,television with 500 channels,some guy's name on my underwear.Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.- Martha Stewart.- Fuck Martha Stewart.She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.It's all going down, man.So fuck off with your sofa unitsand Strinne green stripe patterns.I say never be complete.I say stop being perfect.I say let's evolve.Let the chips fall where they may.But that's me, and I could be wrong.Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.You did lose a lot of versatile solutionsfor modern living.Fuck, you're right. No, I don't smoke.My insurance is probablygonna cover it, so...- What?- The things you own end up owning you.But do what you like, man.Oh, it's late.- Hey, thanks for the beer.- Yeah, man.I should find a hotel.What?What?- A hotel?- Yeah.- Just ask, man.- What are you talking about?Oh, God. Three pitchers of beerand you still can't ask.- What?- You called me'cause you need a place to stay.- Oh, hey. No, no, no.- Yes, you did. So just ask.Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.Would... Would that be a problem?Is it a problem for you to ask?- Can I stay at your place?- Yeah.Thanks.- I want you to do me a favour.- Yeah, sure.I want you to hit me as hard as you can.- What?- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.Let me tell you a little bitabout Tyler Durden.Tyler was a night person.While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked.He had one part-time jobas a projectionist.A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.It comes on a few.So someone has to be there to switchthe projectors at the exact momentthat one reel endsand the next one begins.If you look for them, you can see little dots comeinto the upper right corner of the screen.In the industry,we call them cigarette burns.That's the cue for a changeover.He flips the projectors, movie keeps right ongoing and nobody in the audience has any idea.Why would anyone want this shit job?'Cause it affords him otherinteresting opportunities.Like splicing a frame of pornographyinto family films.So when the snooty catand the courageous dogwith the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel three,that's when you'll catch a flashof Tyler's contribution to the film.Nobody knowsthat they saw it but they did.Nice big cock.Even a hummingbirdcouldn't catch Tyler at work.Tyler also works sometimes as a banquetwaiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.He was the guerrilla terroristof the food service industry.Do not watch.I cannot go when you watch.Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,he farted on meringues,sneezed on braised endives...As for the cream of mushroom soup...- Go ahead, tell 'em.- You get the idea.What do you want me to do?You just want me to hit you?Come on. Do me this one favour.Why?Why? I don't know why. I don't know.Never been in a fight. You?No. But that's a good thing.No it is not. How much can you know aboutyourself if you've never been in a fight?I don't wanna die without any scars.- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.- Oh, God. This is crazy.So go crazy! Let her rip.- I don't know about this.- I don't either.Who gives a shit? No one's watching.What do you care?This is crazy. You want me to hit you?That's right.- Where? Like, in the face?- Surprise me.This is so fucking stupid.Motherfucker! You hit me in the ear!- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.- Ow! Christ!Why the ear, man?- I fucked it up.- No, that was perfect.No, it's all right.It really hurts.Right.- Hit me again.- No, you hit me. Come on!We should do this again sometime.- Where's your car?- What car?I don't know how Tyler found that house,but he said he'd been there for a year.It looked like it waswaiting to be torn down.Most of the windows were boarded up.There was no lock on the front doorfrom when the police,or whoever, kicked it in.The stairs were ready to collapse.I didn't know if he owned itor if he was squatting.Neither would have surprised me.Yep. That's you.That's me. That's the toilet. Good?Yeah, thanks.What a shithole.Nothing worked.Turning on one light meantanother light in the house went out.There were no neighbours.Just some warehouses and a paper mill.That fart smell of steam.The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.Hey. What have we here?- Hey, guys.- Hey.Every time it rained,we had to kill the power.By the end of the first month,I didn't miss TV.I didn't even mind the warm,stale refrigerator.Can I be next?All right, man.Lose the tie.At night, Tyler and I were alonefor half a mile in every direction.Rain trickled down throughthe plaster and the light fixtures.Everything wooden swelled and shrank.Everywhere were rusted nailsto snag your elbow on.The previous occupanthad been a bit of a shut-in.- Hey man, what are you reading?- Listen to this.It's an article writtenby an organ in the first person.""I am Jack's medulla oblongata.""""Without me, Jack could not regulate""his heart rate,blood pressure or breathing.""There's a whole series of these.""I Am Jill's Nipples.""""I Am Jack's Colon.""Yeah. ""I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack.""After fighting, everything else inyour life got the volume turned down.What?- You could deal with anything.- Have you finished those reports?If you could fight anyone,who would you fight?I'd fight my boss, probably.Really?- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?- I'd fight my dad.I don't know my dad.I mean, I know him, but he leftwhen I was, like, six years old.Married this other womanand had some other kids.He, like, did this every six years.- He moves city and starts a new family.- Fucker's setting up franchises.My dad never went to college,so it was real important that I go.That sounds familiar.So I graduate. I call him up long distanceand say, ""Dad, now what?""- He says, ""Get a job.""- Same here.Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.""Dad, now what?""He says, ""I dunno. Get married.""You can't get married.I'm a 30-year-old boy.We're a generation of menraised by women.I'm wondering if another womanis really the answer we need.Most of the week,we were Ozzie and Harriet.But every Saturday night,we were finding something out.We were finding out more and morethat we were not alone.It used to be that when I came home angryor depressed, I'd just clean my condo.Polish my Scandinavian furniture.I should have beenlooking for a new condo.I should have been hagglingwith my insurance company.I should have been upset about my nice,neat, flaming little shit, but I wasn't.The premise of cybernetting an officeis make things more efficient.Monday mornings,all I thought about was next week.Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?Absolutely.Efficiency is priority no. 1, people.Because waste is a thief.I showed this to my man here.You liked it, didn't you?You can swallow a pint of bloodbefore you get sick.It was right in everyone's face.Tyler and I just made it visible.It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.Tyler and I just gave it a name.Come on, people, you've gotta go home!Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.Every week, Tyler gave the rulesthat he and I decided.Gentlemen!Welcome to Fight Club.The first rule of Fight Club isyou do not talk about Fight Club.The second rule of Fight Club is...you do not talk about Fight Club!Third rule of Fight Club:someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,the fight is over.Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.Seventh rule: fights will go onas long as they have to.And the eighth and final rule: if this isyour first night at Fight Club,you have to fight.This kid from work, Ricky,couldn't remember whetheryou ordered pens with blue ink or black.But Ricky was a god for ten minuteswhen he trouncedthe maître d' of a local food court.Sometimes,all you could hear were the flat,hard, packing sounds over the yelling.Or the wet choke when someonecaught their breath and sprayed...Stop!You weren't alive anywherelike you were there.But Fight Club only exists in the hoursbetween when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends.Even if I could tell someonethey had a good fight,I wouldn't be talking to the same man.Who you were in Fight Clubis not who you werein the rest of the world.A guy came to Fight Club for the firsttime. His ass was a wad of cookie dough.After a few weeks,he was carved out of wood.If you could fight any celebrity,who would you fight?- Alive or dead?- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?Hemingway. You?Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.We all started seeing things differently.Everywhere we went,we were sizing things up.I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,trying to look like how Calvin Kleinor Tommy Hilfiger said they should.Is that what a man looks like?Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.Now, self-destruction...Excuse me.Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.It wasn't about words.The hysterical shouting was in tongues,like at a Pentecostal Church.- Is that it?- Stop!When the fight was over,nothing was solved.But nothing mattered.Cool.Afterwards, we all felt saved.Hey, man. How about next week?How about next month?Irvine, you're in the middle.New guy, you too.Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.He fell down some stairs.I fell down some stairs.Fight Club became the reason to cutyour hair short or trim your fingernails.Okay. Any historical figure.- I'd fight Gandhi.- Good answer.- How about you?- Lincoln.Lincoln?Big guy, big reach.Skinny guys fight till they're burger.Fuck!Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.Hello?Where have you beenthe last eight weeks?Marla?- How did you find me?- You left a forwarding number.I haven't seen you at any support groups.We split 'em up.That was the idea. Remember?Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.- How do you know?- I cheated.I found a new one.- Really?- It's for men only.Like the testicle thing?- Look, this is a bad time.- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.- You wanna see some really fucked-up people...- I'm just on my way out.Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.I took what was left of a bottle.It might have been too much.Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herselfaround her crummy apartment.This isn't a for-real suicide thing.This is probably just a cry for help things.This could go on for hours.- So you're staying in tonight then?- Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?Do you wanna listenand see if my spirit can use a phone?Have you ever heard a death rattle before?Tyler's door was closed.I'd been living here for two monthsand Tyler's door was never closed.You won't believe the dreamI had last night.I can hardly believeanything from last night.What are you doing here?- What?- This is my house.What are you doing in my house?Fuck you!Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends! I'm telling you.Limber, though. Silly cooze.So I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.Guess who's on the other end.I already knew the storybefore he told it to me.Have you ever hearda death rattle before?Do you think it'll live up to its name?Or will it just be a death hairball?Prepare to evacuate soul.Ten, nine, eight...Now how could Tyler, of all people,think it was a bad thingthat Marla Singer was about to die?...five, four, three...Hang on.You got here fast.Did I call you?Huh?The mattress is all sealedin slippery plastic.Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.- Hey, where's 513?- End of the hall.The girl who lives thereused to be a charming, lovely girl.She has lost faith in herself.- Miss Singer, let us help you!- She's a monster!- You have every reason to live.- She's infectious human waste!- Miss Singer!- Good luck trying to save her!If I fall asleep, I'm done for.You're gonna have to keep me up...all night.Un-fucking-believable.He was obviously able to handle it.- You know what I mean. You fucked her.- No, I didn't.- Never?- No.- You're not into her, are you?- No! God, not at all.I am Jack's raging bile duct.- Are you sure? You can tell me.- Believe me, I'm sure.Put a gun to my head- and paint the walls with my brains.- That's good.She's a predator posing as a house pet.Stay away.The shit that came out ofthis woman's mouth, I had never heard!My God.I haven't been fucked like thatsince grade school.How could Tyler not go for that?The night before last, he was splicingsex organs into ""Cinderella"".Marla doesn't need a lover,she needs a fucking caseworker.She needs a wash.This isn't love, it's sport fucking.She invaded my support groupsand now she'd invaded my home.Hey, hey. Sit down.- Listen, I can't have you talking to her about me.- Why would I talk to her?You say anything about meor what goes onin this house to her or anybody,we're done.- Now promise me.- Okay.- You promise?- Yeah, I promise.- Promise.- I just said, I promise! What...That's three times you promised.If only I had wasted a couple of minutesand gone to watch Marla Singer die,none of this would've happened.Yes! Oh, harder, harder!I could have moved to another room.On the third floorwhere I might not have heard them.But I didn't.- What are you doing?- Just going to bed.- You wanna finish her off?- Ooh!- No. No, thank you.- I found a cigarette.- Who were you talking to?- Shut up.I became the calmlittle centre of the world.I was the Zen master.I wrote little haiku poems.I emailed them to everyone.Is that your blood?Some of it, yeah.You can't smoke in here.Take the rest of the day off.Come back Monday with some clean clothes.Get yourself together.I got right in everyone's hostile little face.""Yes, these are bruises from fighting.""""Yes, I'm comfortable with that.I am enlightened.""You give up the condo life, give upall your flaming worldly possessions,go live in a dilapidated housein a toxic-waste part of town,and you have to come home to this.Hello?Yes, this is Detective Sternwith the Arson Unit.We have new information aboutthe incident at your former condo.- Yes?- I don't know if you're aware,but it seems that someone sprayed Freoninto your front-door lock.Then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.- No, I wasn't aware of that at all.- I am Jack's cold sweat.- Does this sound strange to you?- Yes, sir. Strange. Very strange.- The dynamite...- Dynamite?...left a residue ofammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.- Do you know what this means?- No. What does it mean?It means it was home-made.I'm sorry. This is just comingas quite a shock to me, sir.See whoever set this dynamitecould have blown outyour pilot light days before the actual explosion.- The gas was just a detonator.- Who'd go and do such a thing?- I'll ask the questions.- Tell him.""Tell him the liberator who destroyed my propertyrealigned my perceptions.""Excuse me. Are you there?Yes. it's hard to knowwhat to make of all this.Have you recently made enemieswho might have accessto home-made dynamite?- Enemies?- ""I reject the basic assumption civilization,""especially the importanceof material possessions.""- Son, this is serious.- Yes, I know it's serious.- I mean that.- Yes, it's very serious.Look, nobody takes this more seriouslythan me. That condo was my life. Okay?I loved every stick offurniture in that place.That was not just a bunch of stuffthat got destroyed.- It was me!- I'd like to thank the Academy.- Is this not a good time for you?- Just tell him you fucking did it!Tell him you blew it all up!That's what he wants to hear.- Are you still there?- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?No, no. I may need to talk to you, so youlet me know if you're gonna leave town.- Okay?- Okay.Except for their humping,Tyler and Marla were neverin the same room.My parents pulledthis exact same act for years.The condom is the glass slipperof our generation.You slip one on when you meet a stranger.You dance all night,then you throw it away.The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.What?I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.It was worth every penny.It's a bridesmaid's dress.Someone loved it intensely for one day,then tossed it.Like a Christmas tree.So special.Then... bam!It's on the side of the road.Tinsel still clinging to it.Like a sex-crime victim, underwearinside out, bound with electrical tape.Well, then, it suits you.You can borrow it sometime.Get rid of her.- What? You get rid of her!- Don't mention me.I am six years old again,passing messages between parents.- You know what? I really think it's time you got out of here.- Don't worry, I'm leaving.- Not that we don't love your little visits.- You know, you are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.♪ Gotta get off ♪Thanks. Bye.♪ Gotta get off of this merry-go-round ♪♪ Gonna get, need to get, gotta get... ♪You kids!Why do you still waste time with her?I'll say this about Marla.At least she's trying to hit bottom.What, and I'm not?Sticking feathers up your buttdoes not make you a chicken.What are we doing tonight?Tonight... we make soap.- Really?- To make soap, first we render fat.The salt balance has to be just right,so the best fat for making soapcomes from humans.- Wait. What is this place?- A liposuction clinic.Pay dirt!Richest, creamiest fat in the world.The fat of the land!No! Don't pull it.- Oh, God!- Give me another one.As the fat renders, the tallows floatto the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.- Keep stirring.Once the tallow hardens,you skim off a layer of glycerine.If you would add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.If you then add sodium nitrateand a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.Yeah, with enough soap,one could blow up just about anything.Tyler was full of useful information.Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleanerwhen washed in a certain point of the river.- You know why?- No.'Cause human sacrifices were once madeon the hills above this river.Bodies burned, water seepedthrough the wooden ashes to create lye.This is lye. The crucial ingredient.Once it mixed with the melted fat of the bodies,thick white soapy discharge crept into the river.May I see your hand, please?What is this?This is a chemical burn.It'll hurt more than you've everbeen burned and you'll have a scar.If meditation worked for cancer,it could work for this.- Stay with the pain. Don't shut this out.- Oh, God!Look at your hand.The first soap was madefrom the ashes of heroes,like the first monkey shot into space.Without pain, without sacrifice,we would have nothing.I tried not to thinkof the words ""searing"" or ""flesh"".Stop it! This is your pain,this is your burning hand. It's right here.I'm going to my caveto find my power animal.No! Don't deal with thisthe way those dead people do! Come on!- I get the point! Okay, please!- No!You're feeling premature enlightenment.It's the greatest moment of your life, man,and you're off somewhere missing it!I am not...Shut up! Our fatherswere our models for God.If our fathers bailed,what does that tell you about God?Listen to me. You have to considerthe possibility that God does not like you.He never wanted you.In all probability, he hates you.This is not the worst thingthat can happen. We don't need him!- We don't! I agree!- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.We are God's unwanted children? So be it!- I'm getting water!- Listen! You can use water and make it worse or...Look at me!- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.- Please let me have it, please!First, you have to give up.First, you have to know, not fear,know that someday, you're gonna die.You don't know how this feels!It's only after we've lost everythingthat we're free to do anything.Okay.Congratulations.You're one step closer to hitting bottom.Tyler sold his soap to department storesat $20 a bar.God knows what they charged.- This is the best soap.- Why, thank you, Susan.It was beautiful.We were selling rich womentheir own fat asses back to them.He was wearing his yellow tie.I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.""The first rule of Fight Clubis you don't talk about Fight Club""?I'm half-asleep again.I must have left it in the copy machine.""The second rule of Fight..."" Is this yours?Pretend you're me.Make a managerial decision.You find this. What would you do?Well, I gotta tell you,I'd be very, very carefulwho you talk to about that.Because the person who wrote thatis dangerous.And this button-down,Oxford-cloth psycho might just snapand then stalk from office to officewith an Armalite AR10 carbinegas-powered semi-automatic weapon,pumping round after roundinto colleagues and co-workers.This might be someoneyou've known for years.Someone very, very close to you.Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.And I used to be such a nice guy.Or maybe you shouldn't bring meevery little piece of trash you pick up.- Compliance and Liability.- My tit's gonna rot off.Will you excuse me? I need to take this.What are you talking about.I need you to checkfor a lump in my breast.- Go to a hospital.- I can't afford to throw money on a doctor.I don't know about this, Marla.Please?She didn't call Tyler.I'm neutral in her book.That's nice. Taking food to...Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.Where are they, exactly?Tragically, they're dead.I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?- No, no.- I got one for you.Thanks for the thought.What happened to your hand?Oh, nothing.Right there?- Feel anything?- No.Well, make sure.- Okay, I'm pretty sure.- You feel nothing?No, nothing.Well, that's a relief. Thank you.- No problem.- I wish I could return the favour.There's not a lot of breast cancerin the men of my family.- I could check your prostate.- I think I'm okay.Well, thanks, anyway.- Are we done?- Yeah, we're done.See you... around.Cornelius?Cornelius!It's me! Bob!Hey, Bob.- We all thought you were dead.- No, no. Still here.How are you, Bob?Better than I've everbeen in my whole life.Really? Still Remaining Men Together?No, no.I got something so much better now.Really, what is it?Well...The first rule is,I'm not supposed to talk about it.And the second rule is...I'm not supposed to talk about it.- And the third rule is...- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.Look at my face, Bob.That's fucking great.- I've never seen you there.- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.- I go Saturday.- Congratulations.Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?Have you heard about the guythat invented this thing?- Yeah, actually...- I hear all kinds of things.Supposedly, he was bornin a mental institutionand he sleeps only one hour a night.- He's a great man.- Oh...Do you know about Tyler Durden?I didn't hurt you, did I?Actually, you did.Thank you for this.Thank you, thank you, thank you.Fight Club.This was mine and Tyler's gift.Our gift to the world.I look around, I look around,I see a lot of new faces.Shut up!Which means a lot of people have beenbreaking the first two rules of Fight Club.Man, I see in Fight Club the strongestand smartest men who've ever lived.I see all this potential.And I see it squandered.Goddamn it,an entire generation pumping gas.Waiting tables.Slaves with white collars.Advertising has us chasingcars and clothes.Working jobs we hateso we can buy shit we don't need.We're the middle children of history, men.No purpose or place.We have no Great War.No Great Depression.Our great war is a spiritual war.Our great depression is our lives.We've all been raised on television tobelieve that one day we'd be millionairesand movie gods and rock stars.But we won't.We're slowly learning that fact.And we're very, very pissed off.Yeah!First rule of Fight Club is,you do not talk about...Who are you?- Who am I?- Yeah.There's a sign on the frontthat says Lou's Tavern.I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?Tyler Durden.Who told you motherfuckersthat you could use my place?We have a deal worked out with Irvine.Irvine?Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.He don't own this place. I do.- How much money does he get for this?- There is no money.- Really?- Free to all.- Ain't that something.- It is, actually.Look, stupid fuck!- I want everybody out of here right now.- Hey! You should join our club.- Did you hear what I just said?- You and your friend.You hear me now?No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.Still not getting it.Okay, okay, okay, I got it.I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.Back! All of you!Everybody back!Ah, Lou!Come on, man! We really like this place.- That's right, Lou. Get it out.- Shut the fuck up.Oh, yeah!That's fucking funny?Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.Unbelievable.- You don't know where I've been, Lou.- Oh, my God!You don't know where I've been!Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!- Fucking use the basement! Christ!- I want your word, Lou! I want your word!On my mother's eyes.Thanks, Lou.You too, big guy.We'll see you next week.This week, each one of youhas a homework assignment.You're gonna go out. You're gonnastart a fight with a total stranger.You're gonna start a fight,and you're gonna lose.Excellent choice, sir.Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.What... Son of a bitch!Most people, normal people,do just about anything to avoid a fight.Excuse me!You sprayed me with your hose.That's not necessary.Jay! Go call 911!Put the hose down.Stop it! Stop it!Sorry.You bastard!We need to talk.Okay.Where to begin?With your constant absenteeism?With your unpresentable appearance?- You're up for review.- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.- What?- Let's pretend.You're the Departmentof Transportation, okay?Someone informs you that this companyinstalls front-seat mounting bracketsthat never pass collision tests,brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,and fuel injectorsthat explode and burn people alive.What then?- Are you threatening me?- No...- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!- I have a better solution.Keep me on the payrollas an outside consultantand, in exchange for my salary,my job will be never to tell peoplethese things that I know.I don't even have to come into the office.I can do this job from home.Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,you crazy little shit?- Security!- I am Jack's smirking revenge.What the hell are you doing?That hurt.Why would you do that?Oh, my God! No! Please stop!What are you doing?Oh, God, no! Please! No!For some reason,I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.No!Under and behind and insideeverything this man took for granted,something horrible had been growing.Look. Just give me the pay cheques,like I asked,and you won't ever see me again.And right then,at our most excellent moment together...Thank God! Please don't hit me again.Telephone, computer, fax machine,52 weekly pay chequesand 48 airline flight coupons.We now had corporate sponsorship.This is how Tyler and I were able to haveFight Club every night of the week.Now, nobody was the centre of Fight Clubexcept the two men fighting.The leader walked through the crowd,out in the darkness.Tyler was now involved in a classaction lawsuit with the Pressman Hotelover the urine content of their soup.I am Jack's wasted life.Thank you, sir.Tyler dreamed upnew homework assignments.He handed them out in sealed envelopes.- Did you know there's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.- Yeah, I heard.There's one in Penns Grove too.Bob even found one up in New Castle.- Yeah, did you start that one?- No, I thought you did.No.- Stop for a second.- What are we doing?- Turn around.- What are we doing?- Homework assignment.- What kind?Human sacrifice.Hey! Is that a gun? Please!Please tell me that's not a gun.It's a gun. Meet me in the back.- No, no! Hey! Don't fuck around!- Meet me in the back.On a long enough time line,the survival rate for everyonedrops to zero.- Stop. What are you doing come on?- Hands behind your back.Give me your wallet.Raymond K. Hessel.1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.Cramped basement apartment?How did you know?'Cause they give shitty basement apartmentsletters instead of numbers.Raymond! You're going to die.No!Is that your mom and dad?Mom and dad are gonna have to callthe kindly doctor.Pick up your dental records. Know why?- There'll be nothing left of your face.- Come on!An expired community college student ID.What did you study, Raymond?- S...

Hessel?The question, Raymond, was:what did you want to be?Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.- Animals.- Yeah. Animal and stuff.- Stuff.

What thefuck was the point of that?Tomorrow will be the most beautiful dayof Raymond K. Hessel's life.His breakfast will taste betterthan any meal you and I have ever tasted.You had to give it to him.- Come on.- He had a plan.And it started to make sensein a Tyler sort of way.No fear. No distractions.The ability to let thatwhich does not matter truly slide.You are not your job.You're not how much moneyyou have in the bank.You're not the car you drive.You're not the contents of your wallet.You're not your fucking khakis.You are the all-singing,all-dancing crap of the world.I'll be out of your way in a sec.You don't have to go.Whatever.No, I mean... it's okay.Are you still going to groups?Yeah.Chloe's dead.Wow.

Why do you keep...Is this making you happy?Yeah, well, sometimes.I don't know. I don't understand.Why does a weaker person need to latchon to a strong person? What is that?What do you get out of it?No... That's not the same thing at all.It's totally different with us.""Us""?- What do you mean by ""us""?- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?- Hear what?- You're not hearing all that noise? Hold on a second.No, wait! What were you saying? Don't changethe subject! I want to talk about this.- You're not talking about me, are you?- No.What?That day you came over to my place,playing doctor. What was going on there?- What are you talking about?- Nothing. Nothing.- I don't think so.- What do you want?- Look at me.- No. What?Look at me.- What is that?- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.- My God.

For what greater good?In Tyler we trusted.When he was like,""You are not your job,"" I was like, ""Yeah!""- Hey, what's all this?- Hey!Okay!- What's going on?- We're celebrating.- What are we celebrating?- Go on.- Hey.- Let me get that for you.Same great taste.Pepsi.

Had I slept?Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?- We've just heard the stories.- What kind of stories?- Nobody knows what he looks like.- He has facial reconstructive surgery every three years.That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?- Is Mr. Durden building an army?I was living in a stateof perpetual déjà vu.Everywhere I went,I felt I'd already been there.It was like following an invisible man.The smell of dried blood.Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.That aroma of old sweat,like fried chicken.The feel of a floor still warmfrom a fight the night before.I was always just one step behind Tyler.His name is Robert Paulsen.His name is Robert Paulsen. His...Welcome back, sir.How have you been?Do you know me?- Is this a test, sir?- No. This is not a test.You were in here last Thursday.Thursday?You were standing where you are now,asking how good security is.It's tight as a drum, sir.Who do you think I am?- Are you sure this isn't a test?- No, this is not a test.You're Mr. Durden.You're the one who gave me this.Please return your seat backsto their full upright and locked position.- Yeah?- Marla, it's me.- Have we ever done it?- Done what?- Have we ever had sex.- What kind of stupid question is that?Stupid because the answer's yesor because the answer's no?- Is this a trick?- No, Marla.

This is crazy.- People do it every day.They talk to themselves.They see themselves as they'd like to be.They don't have the courage you haveto just run with it.Naturally, you're still wrestling with it,so sometimes you're still you.We should do this again sometime.Other times,you imagine yourself watching me.If this is your firsttime, you have to fight.Little by little,you're just letting yourself become...Tyler Durden.You are not your jobor how much money you have!- No. You have a house.- Rented in your name.- You have jobs, you have a life.- You work nights because you can't sleep.- Or you stay up and make soap.- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.Technically, you're fucking Marla.But it's all the same to her.Oh, my God.Now you see our dilemma.She knows too much.I think we're gonna have to talk abouthow this might compromise our goals.What... What are you saying?This is... This is bullshit. This is bullshit!I'm not listening to this.- You are insane!- No. You're insane.And we simplydo not have time for this crap.It's called a changeover.The movie goes on,and nobody in the audience has any idea.- Sir!

Thank you.You got about 30 seconds.I know I've been actingvery very strange, okay?I know that it's gotta seemlike there's two sides to me...Two sides?You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.I deserved that. But I've come torealise something very very important.What?The full extent of our relationshipwasn't really clear to me up until now,for reasons I'm not gonna go into.- I know I haven't been treating you so nice.- Whatever.No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry.Because what I've come to realizeis that I really like you, Marla.- You do?- I really do.I care about you and I don't want anythingbad to happen to you because of me.Marla, your life is in danger.- What?- You need to leave town for a while.Get out of any major city.And just go camping...You're an insane person.- I've involved you in something terrible.- No. Shut up!- You're not safe.- Shut up!- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.- I know you did.There are things about you I like. You'resmart, you're funny, you're spectacular in bed.But... you're intolerable.You have very serious emotional problems,deep-seeded problemsfor which you should seekprofessional help.- I know, and I'm sorry.- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry, but...I can't do this anymore.I can't. I won't.I'm gone.You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!- Marla, wait you don't understand!- Leave me alone!I am trying to protect you!- I don't ever want to see you again!- If that's what it takes...Wait right here.Hold it right there!

And I promise Iwill never bother you again if that's what you want.Shut up!Please get on the bus.Please get on the bus.- Why are you doing this?- 'Cause they think you're some kind of a threat.I can't explain it right now. Trust me.If I see where you're going,you won't be safe.I'm not paying this back.I consider it asshole tax.That's fine. Remember, stay out of major citiesfor at least a couple of days, okay?Tyler...You're the worst thingthat ever happened to me.Hello. I need you to arrest me.I am the leader of a terrorist organizationresponsible for numerous acts of vandalismand assault all over this city.In the metropolitan area, we hadprobably a couple hundred members.Chapters have sprung upin five or six other major cities already.This is a tightly regimented organizationwith many cells capable of operatingcompletely independent of central leadership.Go to the house, okay? 1537 Paper Street.That's our headquarters.In the back, buried in the garden,you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubsthat have been used very recentlyto make large quantities of nitroglycerin.I believe the plan isto blow up the headquartersof these credit-card companiesand the TRW building.Why these buildings?Why credit-card companies?If you erase the debt record,then we all go back to zero.You'll create total chaos.Keep him talking.I need to make a phone call.I really admire what you're doing.- What?- You're a brave man to order this.You're a genius, sir.You said if anyone ever interfereswith Project Mayhem, even you,we gotta get his balls.- It's useless to fight.- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.- It'll set quite an example.- You're making a big mistake!- You said you'd say that.- I'm not Tyler Durden!You told us you'd say that too.All right. I am Tyler Durden.Listen to me. I'm giving you a directorder. We're aborting this mission right now.You said you would definitely say that.Let me go!Are you fucking out of your minds?You're police officers!Is somebody timing this?Keep your mouth shut.Shit!- Some of this information checks out.- Uh-huh?- Let's go over to that house on Paper Street.- Be right there.Hey, wait!- You got him?- I got him.Sir, we have to do this.- Stop fighting!- Where's the rubber band?Get away from me!Drop that fucking knife! Drop it!Back up. Face down on thefloor, both of you, right now!Get down on the floor!First person that comes out this doorgets a lead salad! You understand?Get away! Stay away!I ran.I ran until my muscles burnedand my veins pumped battery acid.Then I ran some more.What the fuck are you doing,running around in your underpants?Man, you look like a crazy person.No. I'm onto you.I know what's going on here.Come on, then. I got us a great placeto watch from. it'll be like pay-per-view.Oh, Christ.Now what are you doing?- I'm stopping this.- Why?- The greatest thing you've ever done, man.- No, I can't let this happen.You know there are 10 other bombsin 10 other buildings.Goddamn it! Since when is Project Mayhemabout murder?The buildings are empty. Security,maintenance, all our people.We're not killing anyone, man.We're setting them free!Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.You wanna make an omelet,you gotta break eggs.No. I'm not listening to you.You're not even there.Wouldn't do that.Not unless I knew which wires were what.If you know, then I know.Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spentthe whole day thinking about the wrong ones.You think?Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.Pull any one but the green one.I asked you not to do that!Fuck!Tyler, get away from the van.Tyler, I'm not kidding!Get away from the van!Goddamn it!Okay.You are now firing a gunat your imaginary friendnear 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!Cool it, Tyler! Tyler!Aw, come on! Don't go!What?Three minutes.

Flashback humour.It's getting exciting now.Two and a half. Think of everythingwe've accomplished, man.Out these windows, we will viewthe collapse of financial history.One step closer to economic equilibrium.- Why is she here?- Tying up loose ends.Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!- I'm begging you, please don't do this.- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.- This is what we want.- No. I don't want this.Right.

Why can't I get rid of you?- You need me.No. I don't. I really don't anymore.You created me. I didn't create someloser alter ego to make me feel better.- Take some responsibility.- I do.I am responsible for all of it,and I accept that.So, please, I'm begging you,please call this off.Have I ever let us down?How far have you come because of me?I will bring us through this.As always, I will carry youkicking and screaming,and in the end you will thank me.Tyler. Tyler.I'm grateful to youfor everything that you've done for me.But this is too much. I don't want this.What do you want? You wanna go back to your shitjob?

He screwed it first,- then he set it on fire.- Hey, shut up.Why didn't the computerjust kill Connor then?Why this elaborate schemewith the Terminator?It had no choice. Theirdefense grid was smashed.We'd won. Taking out Connorthen would make no difference.Skynet had to wipe outhis entire existence.Is that when you captured the lab complexand found that... uh, what is it called?Uh... the timedisplacement equipment?That's right. The Terminatorhad already gone through.Connor sent me to intercept,and they blew the whole place.How are you supposed get back?I can't.Nobody goes home.Nobody else comes through.It's just him and me.It's just him and me.Why didn't you bring any weapons,something more advanced?Don't you have ray guns?Ray guns.Show me a piece offuture technology.You go naked. Something about thefield generated by a living organism.- Nothing dead will go.- Why?- I didn't build the fucking thing!- OK, OK. But this...- Cyborg, if it's metal...- Surrounded by living tissue!Oh. Right, right...This is great stuff. I couldmake a career out of this guy.You see how clever this part is? Howit doesn't require a shred of proof?And most paranoid delusions areintricate, but this is brilliant.Why were the othertwo women killed?Most of the recordswere lost in the war.Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor'smother. Her full name, where she lived.They just knew the city. TheTerminator was just being systematic.- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...- Look, you have heard enough!I have answered your questions!Now I have to see Sarah Connor!- I'm afraid that's not up to me.- Then why am I talking to you?- Because I can help you.- Who is in authority here?- Reese...- Shut up!You still don't get it, do you?He'll find her.That's what he does!That's all he does!You can't stop him!He'll wade through you, reach down herthroat, and pull her fucking heart out!- Doc.- Let... let go of me!Sorry.- So, Reese is crazy?- In technical terminology...He's a loon.Sarah, this is whatthey call body armor.Our TAC guys wear these. It'llstop a twelve-gauge round.This other individual must have been wearingone under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.What about when he punchedthrough the windshield?He was probably on PCP.Broke every bone in his handand wouldn't feel it for hours.There was this guy once...- You see this scar?- Here.Thank you.There's a couch in this other room. Why don'tyou stretch out and try to get some sleep?It'll be at least an hour before yourmother gets here from Big Bear.- I can't sleep.- Try.Well, it may not look it, butthat couch is very comfortable.You'll be perfectly safe. We gotthirty cops in this building.Thank you.- Good night.- Good night.I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.I was told that she's here.Could I see her, please?No. You can't see her.She's making a statement.- Where is she?- Look, it may take a while...if you want to wait, there'sa bench over there.I'll be back.What the hell was that?Gunshot!- What is it, terrorists?- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!Stay here.Let's get out of here!- Come on! Come on!- He's got an automatic weapon!Move it, move it, move it, move it!What the hell happenedto the lights?Watch him.Automatic weapons!Lock and load! Let's go!Fire!

Anything.Just talk. Tell me about my son.He's about my height.He has your eyes.What's he like?You trust him. He's got a strength.I'd die for John Connor.Well... at least now I knowwhat to name him.I don't suppose youknow who the father is,so I won't tell him to getlost when I meet him.John never said much about him.- I know he dies before the war...- Wait!I don't want to know.So, was it John that sent you here?I volunteered.Why?It was a chance to meet thelegend... Sarah Connor.Taught her son to fight, organize,prepare from when he was a kid.When you were in hidingbefore the war...You're talking about things Ihaven't done yet in the past tense.- It's driving me crazy.- Aah!Are you sure you havethe right person?I'm sure.Come on.

6,The Hunger Games,"Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games.  Part twisted entertainment, part government intimidation tactic, the Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which “Tributes” must fight with one another until one survivor remains.  Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she’s ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.",8.5,(2012),"In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, rutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives.","I think it's our tradition
It comes out of a
particularly painful
part of our history.
Yes. Yes.
But it's been a way
we've been able to heal.
At first it was a
reminder of the rebellion
It was the price the
Districts had to pay.
But I think it has grown from that.
I think it's a
It's something that
knits us all together.
This is your third year's game?
What defines your personal signature?
Shhhh. It's okay.
It's okay.
You're just dreaming.
You're dreaming.
It was me.
I know. But it's not.
It's your first year.
Prim, your name's only
been there once, they're
not gonna pick you!
Try to go to sleep.
I can't.
Just try.
Just try.
Deep in the meadow.
Under the willow.
Hop in the grass.
A soft green and pillow.
You remember that song?
Ok.
You finish it.
I gotta go.
Where?
I just gotta go.
But I'll be back.
I love you.
I'll still cook you.
What are you gonna do
with that when you kill it?
Damn you, Gale!
It's not funny.
What're you gonna do with
a 100 pound deer, Katnap?
It's Reaping Day, the place is
crawling with Peacekeepers.
I was gonna sell it,
to Peacekeepers.
Of course you were.
Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers.
No! Not today.
It was the first deer, I've seen in a year.
Now, I have nothing.
Okay.
What if they did? Just one you.
Why if everyone just stop watching?
They won't, Gale.
What if they did? What if we did?
It won't happen.
You root for your favorite, you cry
when they get killed. It's sick.
Yeah.
If no one watches..,..
Then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.
What?
Nothing.
Fine, laught at..,..
I'm not laughing at you.
We could do it, you know?
Take off. Live in the woods.
What we do anyway?
They'd catch us.
Maybe not.
Cut out our tongues or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.
No, I get five miles.
I'd go that way.
I have Prim and you have your brothers.
They can come too.
Prim in the woods?
Maybe not.
I'm never having kids.
I might.
If I don't live here.
But you do live here.
I know, but if I didn't.
Oh, I forgot.
Here.
Oh my God!
Is this real?
Yeah. Better be.
Cost me a squirrel.
Happy Hunger Games.
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.
How many times has your
name entered it?
Forty two.
Guess the odds aren't
exactly in my favor.
Thank you girl.
What's this?
That's a..,.. Mockingjay.
How much?
You keep it.
It's yours.
Thank you.
Mom?
Aww. Look at you.
You look beautiful.
Let's better tuck in
that tail by the back.
Made something out for you two.
Okay.
Now you look beautiful too.
Wish I look liked you.
Oh no.
I wish I look liked you.
You wanna see
what I got you today?
It's a Mockingjay pin.
To protect you.
And as long as you have it.
Nothing bad will happen to you.
Okay?
I promise.
Shh.
Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.
Okay, it's time to send her now.
Okay, they will prick your finger
to take just a little bit of blood.
I'm scared.
Prim, it doesn't hurt
much. Just a little.
Okay?
Go sit down there
with the little kids.
I'll find you after okay?
Next.
Next.
Go ahead.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Welcome.
Welcome. Welcome.
Happy Hunger Games.
And..,..
May the odds be ever in your favor.
Now, before we begin.
We have a very special film.
Brought to you all the
way from the Capitol.
War..,..
Terrible war.
With those..,..
Orphan..,.. and a motherless child.
This was the uprising
that rocked our land.
Thirteen districts rebeled against
the country that fed them, Loved them.
Protected them. Brother turned on brother until
nothing remained.
Then came the peace.
Hard fought.
Sorely won.
The people.
Rose up from the ashes
and a new era was born.
But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.
We swore as a nation
we would never know
this treason again.
And so it was decreed..,..
That each year.
The various districts of Panem
would offer up in tribute
One young man and woman
to fight to the death
in a pageant of honor,
courage and sacrifice.
The lone victor..,..
Bathed in riches..,..
would serve as a reminder of
our generosity
and our forgiveness.
This is how we remember our past.
This is how we safeguard our future.
I just love that.
Now, the time has come for us to
select
one courageous
young man and woman.
For the honor of
representing District
12 in the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.
As usual..,..
ladies first.
Primrose Everdeen!
Where are you dear?
Come on up.
Well, come on up!
Prim!
Prim!
No!
I volunteer!
I volunteer as Tribute.
I believe we have a volunteer.
- You need to get out of here.
- No!
- Go find mom!
- No!
- Prim, go find mom!
- No!
I'm so sorry!
No!
Noo!
Noo! Nooo! Noooo!
In mad of turn of events
here on District 12.
District 12's very first volunteer.
Big breath.
Come on dear.
What's your name?
Katniss Everdeen.
Well, I bet my hat
that was your sister.
Wasn't it?
Yes.
Let's have a big hand for our very
first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.
And now..,..
for the boys.
Peeta Mellark.
Here we are.
Our Tributes from District 12.
Well, come on you two. Shake hands.
Happy Hunger Games.
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.
You have 3 minutes.
Prim, Prim, its okay.
Shh. Prim, I don't have much time.
Prim, listen.
You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.
It isn't worth putting in your
name more times, okay?
Listen, Prim.
Gale will bring you game.
you can sell cheese from your goat.
Just try to win. Maybe you can.
Maybe I can, I'm smart you know?
You can hunt.
Exactly.
To protect you.
Thank you.
You can't tune out again.
I won't.
No, you can't.
Not like when dad died.
I won't be there anymore.
You're all she has.
No matter what you feel, you will
be there for her. Do you understand?
Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't.
It's time.
It's okay. Prim, it's okay.
No! No!
I promise Prim.
I'm fine.
Yeah, I know.
I am.
Listen to me.
You're stronger than they are.
You are.
Get to a bow. / I may not have a bow..,..
What will if you show them how good you are.
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?
Okay? You know how to hunt.
Animals.
There's no different Katniss.
They're twenty four of us, Gale,
and only one comes out.
Yeah.
And it's gonna be you.
Okay.
Take care of them Gale.
Whatever you do, don't
let them starve.
Let's go!
I'll see you soon okay?
You two haven't had trip?
Crystal chandeliers.
Platinum donuts.
200 miles per hour and you
can barely feel a thing.
I think its one of the wonderful
thing is about this opportunity,
that even though you're here and even
though it's just for a little while.
You get to enjoy all of this.
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.
Have you ever met him?
Haymitch?
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this things once.
Look!
You know if you don't want to talk,
I understand. But I just don't
think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.
Congratulations.
Where's the ice?
I don't..,.. I don't know.
Okay, so uh..,..
so when do we start?
Whoah.
You're so eager.
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.
Yeah.
I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor,
you're supposed to go..,..
Mentor?
Yeah.
Our mentor, you're supposed to tell us how
to get sponsors and give us advice.
Oh, okay.
Ummm..,..
embrace the probability
of your imminent death.
and know,
in your heart,
that there's nothing I
can do to save you.
So why are you here then?
The refreshments.
Okay, I think that's enough of that.
You made me spill my drink.
It's a brand new pants.
You know,
I think I'll go finish this in my room.
He's gonna come around.
What? It's no use.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
We have two..,.. 16 year olds.
Yes.
Do you remember this year?
Aww. One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite arenas.
The use of the rubble, the ruin city.
Very exciting.
And this moment here..,..
this moment..,..
is the moment that
you never forget.
The moment..,..
when a Tribute..,..
becomes a victor.
You'd freeze to death first.
No, cause I'd have a lot of fire.
Now that's a good
way to get killed.
What's a good way to get killed?
Oh! Joy.
Why don't you join us?
I'm just saving a life-saving advice.
Like what?
I wa..,.. I was just asking
about how to find shelter.
Which would come in handy if
in fact you were still alive.
How do you find shelter?
Pass the jam?
How do you find shelter?
Give me a chance to
wake up sweetheart.
This mentoring is very..,..
taxing stuff.
Can you pass the marmalade?
That is mahogany.
Look at you!
Just killed a..,.. place mat!
You really wanna know
how to stay alive?
You get people to like you.
Oh!
Not what you're expecting.
When you're in the
middle of the games..,..
and you're starving or freezing,
some water,
a knife or even some
matches can mean
the difference between
life and death.
And those things only
comes from Sponsors.
And to get Sponsors, you have
to make people like you.
And right now, sweetheart,
You're not off to a
really good start.
There it is.
It's huge.
That's incredible.
Come on.
You better keep this knife,
he knows what he's doing.
So now that you've seen them,
what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?
Are there any surprises that
we can expect this year?
It's really hard to tell from
a reaping but I think..,..
this is a very interesting mix.
Yes.
Whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,
that's something you can't ignore.
What's that?
What's that?
We were just saying
we might need to hose
you down again before
we take you to Cinna.
That was on of the bravest
thing I've ever seen for your sister.
My name is Cinna.
Katniss.
I'm sorry that this happened to you.
And I'm here to help
you in any way I can.
Most people just congratulate me.
I don't see the point in that.
So tonight
they have the Tribute Parade.
they're gonna take you out and
show you off to the world.
So you're here to
make me look pretty.
I'm here to help you
make an impression.
Now usually, they dress people in
their close to their district.
Yeah. our's was coal miners.
Yeah. But I don't wanna to do that.
I'm gonna do something that
they're gonna remember.
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.
We'll see.
I just think, somebody that brave
shouldn't be dressed up on some
stupid costume now, should they?
I hope not.
It's not real fire. These suits are
built so you won't feel a thing.
That very well to me.
The idea..,..
You ready?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Over one hundred
thousand people craning
to get a glimpse this
year's Tributes.
And the Sponsors get to see
the Tributes for the first time.
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.
Very nice.
First cheered on my counting in 15..,..
..,..14..,.. 13..,..
Here they are. Here they are.
This year's Tributes.
It looks exciting.
It just gives you goose bumps.
Don't you love how the stylists,
they so clearly are able to reflect
the character of each district?
Right, right.
There's District 4!
Yes,
the fishing.
I get it. I like it.
That's very good.
And behind them
we have two power plant workers, right?
And then
what is that in the background?
Come on. They'll love it.
Now see that! I love that.
Two young people,
holding their hands up!
Saying; ""I'm proud,
I'm from District 12.
We will not be overlooked!""
I love that.
People are sure to be paying
attention to them right now.
And we're ready.
President Snow, you're live!
Welcome.
Welcome.
Tributes.
We welcome you.
We salute
the courage
and your sacrifice.
And we wish you
happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.
That was amazing.
We are all anybody's
going to be talking about!
So brave.
Are you sure you should be
near an opening flame?
Fake flame?
Are you sure?
Let's uh..,..
let's go upstairs.
So each of the districts
got their own floor and
because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.
Come on.
So this is the living room.
I know!
Now, your rooms are right over here.
Why don't you go clean yourselves
up a little before dinner.
In two weeks
twenty three of you will be dead.
One of you will be alive.
Who that is depends
on how well you pay
attention over the
next four days.
Particularly to what
I'm about to say.
First. No fighting with
the other Tributes.
You'll have plenty of time
for that in the arena.
There are four compulsory exercises,
the rest will be individual training.
My advice is;
Don't ignore the survival skills.
Everybody wants to
grab a sword but most
of you wil die from
natural causes.
10% from infection.
20% from dehydration.
Exposure can kill as
easily as a knife.
Where's my knife?
Where did you put it?
I put my knife..,..
Don't touch me..,..
Fuck! You took my knife!
I didn't touch your knife.
I didn't touch your kni..,..
You liar.
You little punk!
You took my knife.
Get off me.
Just sit here.
I should better wait for the arena.
You're the first one I get
so watch your back huh!
Everybody back in line.
You know you're next to me Cato!
He's a career.
You know what that is?
From District 1.
..,..and 2.
They train in a special academy until
they're eighteen then they volunteer,
By that point,
they're pretty lethal.
But they don't receive
any special treatment.
they stay in the exact same
apartment as you do.
And I don't think they let them
have desert, and you can.
So how good are they?
They win it almost every year, but..,..
They won in almost
several year but..,..
Almost..,..
They can be arrogant.
And arrogance can
be a big problem.
I hear you can shoot.
I'm alright.
She's better than alright,
my father buys her squirrels.
He say she hits them right
in the eye everytime.
- Peeta's strong.
- What?
He can throw a hundred
pound sack of flour
right in his head. I've seen it.
Okay, well I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.
No, you might have a
better chance of winning
if somebody comes after
you with a knife.
I have no chance of winning.
None! Alright?
It's true.
Everybody knows it.
You know what my mother said?
She said, ""District 12 might
finally have a winner!""
But she wasn't talking about me.
She was talking about you.
I'm not very hungry.
I'm done too.
Throw that metal
thing over there.
What?
No.
Haymitch says we're not
supposed to show our skills.
I don't care what Haymitch said.
Those guys are looking at
you like you're a meal.
Throw it.
Hi.
Hey.
How did you do that?
I uh..,..
I used to take care of the
cakes down at the bakery.
I'll show you.
See?
Wow.
Yeah.
I think you have a shadow.
Tomorrow.
They'll bring you in one by one.
they'll evaluate you.
This is important because high
ratings will mean Sponsors.
This is the time to
show them everything.
There'll be a bow,
make sure you use it.
Peeta, you make sure
to show your strength.
They'll start with District 1
so the two of you will go last.
Well, I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.
Katniss Everdeen.
Hey Katniss.
Shoot straight.
Katniss Everdeen.
District 12.
Thank you,
for your consideration.
Are you crazy?
I just got mad.
Mad?
You realize that your actions
reflect badly on all of us,
not just you.
They just want a good
show, it's fine.
How about it's just bad manner, Cinna?
How about that?
Well, finally!
I hope you noticed, we
have a serious situation.
Nice shooting sweetheart!
Wha.. Wha..,.. What did they..,..
What did they do when
you shot the apple?
Well, they look pretty startled.
What did you say..,.. ""Thanks for..,.. ""
..,..consideration. Genius!
Genius.
I don't think we're gonna
find this funny
If the game makers decided
to take it out..,..
On who? On her?
On him?
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset and have a drink.
I would have given
anything to see it.
As you know the Tributes
are rated on a scale of
one to twelve after three days
of careful evaluation.
The game keepers would
like to evaluate..,..
From District 1, Marvel.
score of 9.
Cato, score of 10.
Clove, score of 10.
Four, score of..,..
From District 7..,..
From District..,..
Rue, score of 7.
From District 12..,..
Peeta Mellark..,..
score of..,..
Eight.
- Ooh, Peeta.
- Not bad. Bravo.
And finally..,..
From District 12
Katniss Everdeen.
With score of..,...
Eleven.
Congratulations.
I thought they hated me.
They must have liked your guts.
To Katniss Everdeen..,..
The Girl On Fire!
An eleven?
She earned it.
She shot an arrow at your head.
Well, at an apple.
Near your head.
Sit down.
Seneca,
why do you think we have a winner?
What do you mean?
I mean,
why do we have a winner?
I mean if we just wanted
to intimidate
the Districts, why not round up
twenty four at random, and execute
them all at once? Way a lot faster..,..
Hope.
Hope?
Hope.
It is the only thing
stronger than fear.
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.
Spark is fine,
as long as it's contained.
So?
So..,.. contain it.
Right.
If she's staring at all my jewels,
she cannot take her eye from..,..
Frankly..,.. it was rude.
Oh, Haymitch.
You should join us.
We're having some of
your favorite dish.
Oh, lovely.
Where's Peeta?
He's in his room. Now listen
Tomorrow's the last day.
And they let us work with our
own tributes right
before the game so you and
I will be going down at nine.
Well, what about him?
No, he says he wants to be
trained on his own from now on.
What?
It's kind of thing does happen
at this point.
There's only one winner, right?
We should have some
chocolate covered stroke.
Hm, right
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Your master of ceremonies..,..
Caesar Flickerman!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
To the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
Now, we all have five minutes that they
are all going to be out here.
All of the Tributes
that you heard about.
Are you excited?
Let me hear it!
Amazing.
I don't feel amazing.
Don't you know how
beautiful you look?
No. And I don't know
how to make people
like me, how do you
make people like you?
Well you made me like you.
That's different,
I wasn't trying.
Exactly.
Just be yourself.
I'll be there the whole time,
and just pretend
you're talking to me.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's see if she
does indeed shine.
Let's have a warm round
of applause for Glimmer.
Glimmer, are you prepared?
Yes Caesar, I am very prepared.
I like it, that's insurance,
self-insurance.
Big round of applause.
Marvel!
Welcome Clove.
It's an honor to
represent my district.
So you're a fighter?
I'm prepared, vicious
and I'm ready to go.
Cato!
I can apply myself to situation present
and I'll be able to. thank you.
It's lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.
From District 12..,..
You know her
as the girl on fire!
Where we know her as the
lovely Katniss Everdeen!
What?
I think someone's a little nervous.
I said that was quite and
entrance that you've
made at the Tribute's
parade the other day.
Do you want to tell us about it?
Well, I was just
hoping that I
wouldn't burned to death.
When you came out of that chariot,
I have to say
My heart..,.. stopped.
Did any of you experience this as well?
My heart stopped.
So did mine.
Now tell me bout the flames.
Were they real?
Yes.
In fact I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?
Wait, wait, wait.
Is it safe?
What do you think folks?
I think that's a yes!
Ohhh. Steady. Steady.
Lovely make it.
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.
That was something.
Thank you for that.
I have one more question for you.
It's about your sister,
We were all very moved,
I think when,
you volunteered for
her at the reaping.
Does she come to say goodbye to you.
Yes.
She did.
She did.
And what did you say to her,
In the end?
I told her that I would try to win.
That I will try to win for her.
Of course you did.
And try you will.
Ladies and gentlemen,
from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen,
The Girl On Fire!
You did it darling.
That was incredible.
Thank you.
Nice job sweetheart.
Thank you.
Nice dress too.
Not yours.
Please welcome, Peeta Mellark!
Peeta, welcome.
How are you finding the Capitol?
Don't say with a map.
Uh, it's uh..,.. different.
It's very different.
Different? In what way?
Give us an example.
Uh okay, well the
showers here are weird.
Showers?
Yes.
We have different showers.
I have a question for you Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?
Um..,..
Do I?
Yeah.
Do I smell like it?
You definitely smell
better than I do.
Well I live here longer.
That makes sense.
Lovely, So Peeta..,..
tell me.
Is there a special girl back home?
No, not really.
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you, Peeta.
Tell me.
Well, there a
There's this one girl that
I had a crush on forever.
But I don't think she actually
recognize me until the reaping.
Well..,..
I'll tell you what Peeta.
You go out there..,..
and you win this thing.
And when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.
Right folks?
Thanks but I uh..,..
I don't think winnings
gonna help me at all.
And why not?
Because she came here with me.
Well, that's bad luck.
Yeah. It is.
And I wish you all the best of luck.
Thank you.
Peeta Mellark.
District 12!
What the hell is that?!
You don't talk to me and then you
say you have a crush on me?
You say you wanna train alone?
Is that how you wanna play?
Stop! Stop it!
Let's start right now.
He did you a favor.
He made me look weak.
He made you look desirable.
Which in your case,
can't hurt sweetheart!
He's right Katniss.
Of course, I'm right.
Now I can sell the star cross
lovers from District 12.
We are not star cross lovers.
It's a television show.
And being in love with
that boy might just get
you sponsors which could
save your damn life.
Okay,
why don't you get out of here?
Maybe I can deliver you
both in one piece tomorrow.
Manners.
You too?
Oh, hey.
Can't sleep?
No, of course not.
I'm sorry I went after you.
You know I meant that
as a compliment.
I know.
Listen to them.
Yeah?
I just hope they don't change me.
How would they change you?
I don't know.
Turn me into something I'm not.
I just don't wanna be another
piece in their game, you know?
You mean you won't kill anyone?
No.
No. I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else when
the time came.
Yeah, I just keep..,..
But, you know, I just keep wishing
I could think of a way to show them
that they don't own me.
You know, if I'm gonna die,
I wanna still be me.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
I just can't afford
to think like that.
I miss my sister.
Yeah I know.
Guess, I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
They put all kind of
stuff right in front.
Right in the mouth of the
Cornucopia.
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.
Why not?
It's a bloodbath, they're
trying to pull you in.
That's not your game.
You turn, run, find
a high ground.
Look for water.
Water's your new best friend.
Don't step off that pedestal earlier
or they'll blow you sky high.
I won't.
Katniss.
You can do this.
Thanks.
Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.
What is that?
Your tracker.
Less than a minute people!
Final checks.
So fifteen up, they are flying.
Here.
Thank you.
30 seconds.
I'm not allowed to bet.
But if I could I'd bet on you!
20 seconds.
10 seconds.
Okay, they're in the tubes.
50..,..

..,..29..,.. 28
..,..27..,.. 26..,..
..,..25..,.. 24..,..
..,..23..,.. 22..,..
And of course..,..
There's the familiar
boom of the cannon.
Which marks the end of
another fallen Tribute.
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.
And Claudius, I think I
see alliance forming.
Please don't kill me. Oh no!
Hey, loverboy!
You sure she went this way?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You better be.
Yeah. That was a steer
comb back there.
Are you sure we shouldn't
just kill him now?
Nah. He's our best
chance at finding her. Let's go.
Let's go.
Sir.
She is almost at the edge.
Two kilometers away from
the nearest Tribute.
Let's turn her around.
Killing another on my account..,.. one.
Two.
Uh, she's heading
towards the left flank.
Okay.
- Can you give me tree back there?
- Sure.
She's almost there.
Lucia, get a cannon ready.
Oh there she is. There she is.
What you got baby?
Kill here Cato!
I'm coming for you!
I'll do it myself.
Get her!
Come on. Come on.
Maybe you should throw the sword.
Let's just wait her out.
She gotta come down at some point,
it's that or starve to death.
Let's kill her then.
Okay.
Somebody make a fire.
Thank you.
Claudius. I think those are
tracker jackers. Am I wrong?
Oooh.
Those things are very lethal.
Very.
For those of you who don't know Tracker jackers..,..
Are genetically engineered wasps.
Whose venom causes searing pain.
Powerful hallucinations and
in extreme cases, death.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Damn it. Go!
Katniss, no! What're you doing?
Go!
Hallow isn't lethal.
But the venom of a
tracker jacker sting
is powerfull to hallucinations.
Mom, please..,..
Please..,..
Mom, don't sit there ! Look at me !
Mom, don't sit there ! Look at me !
Please do something.
Katniss, go!
Get out of here!
What're you doing? Go!
Rue?
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
You want mine too?
No, that's okay.
Here.
Thanks.
How long was I asleep?
A couple of days.
I change your leaves twice.
Thank you.
So what happened? When I was out?
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.
And the uh..,..
And the boy from my district?
No, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.
Is all about true?
What?
You and him.
So where are Cato and the others?
They got all their
supplies down by the lake.
It's prod up in this
great big pyramid.
That sounds tempting.
Now this green stuff is
gonna smoke like crazy, so
as soon as you light it.
Move on to the next fire.
Light this one last.
And I'll meet you back over there.
Right.
I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.
We need a signal, in case
one of us gets held up.
Okay. Like what?
Here. Watch this.
Mockingjays.
That's great.
Back home we use them
signal all the time.
You try.
Okay so, if we hear that means we're
okay and we'll be back real soon.
We're gonna be okay.
Hey.
I'll see you for supper.
Okay.
Guys, guys look!
Come here. Come on, come on look!
Let's go.
You stay guard over, till we get back.
I wanna see if she's gonna
figure out this booby trap.
Yes. It seems they
reburied their mines
around that big pile of goodies.
She certainly figure
it out, haven't she?
Katniss!
Katniss!
Katniss, help!
Katniss!
Katniss ! Help!
Katniss!
Katniss!
It's okay.
You're okay.
You're alright.
You're fine.. see?
It's okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Did you blow up the food?
Every bit of it.
Good.
You have to win.
Bisakah kau bernyanyi ?
Okay.
Deep in the meadow.
Under the willow.
A bed of grass.
A soft, green pillow.
Lay down your head.
And close your eyes.
Don't kill her.
You'd just create a martyr.
Well it seems we've already got one.
I hear these rumors out of district 11,
This could get away from here.
What do you want?
You have a lot of anger out there.
I know you know how to handle
a mob, you've done it before.
If you can't scare them.
Give them something to root for.
Such as?
Young love.
So you like an an underdog.
Everyone likes an underdog.
I don't.
How many are dead?
10? 11? 12?
Uh..,..
Not personally, no!
Well I have.
Lots of underdogs.
Not too coal too.
Raw crops. Minerals.
Things we need.
There are lots of underdogs.
And I think if you could see them.
You would not root for the martyr.
I like you,
be careful.
Attention Tributes. Attention!
The regulations acquiring a single
victor has been suspended!
From now on, two victors maybe
crowned if both originate
from the same district.
This will be the only announcement.
Peeta.
Oh my God! Peeta!
Peeta!
Hi.
It's okay.
What was it?
The sword.
It's bad, huh?
It's gonna be fine.
Katniss..,..
Katniss!
No!
I'm not gonna leave you!
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
Nobody's gonna find you in here.
They already found me.
We'll just get you some medicine.
I'm not gonna get many parachutes.
We'll figure something out.
Like what?
Something.
Is that medicine?
No!
Soup.
No, I'll do it.
Nice taste.
Well, you fed me once?
I think about that all the time.
How I tossed you that bread.
Peeta.
I should have gone to you.
I should've just gone
out in the rain and..,...
You feel hot.
I remember the first time I saw you.
Your hair was in two
braids instead of one.
I remember when you..,..
You sang in music assembly,
the teacher said;
Who knows The Valley song?
And your hand shot straight up.
Peeta, stop.
After that,
I watched you going home everyday.
Everyday.
Well, say something.
I'm not good at saying something.
Then come here. Please.
Please.
Even if I don't make it..,..
Ssh!
Attention Tributes. Attention!
Commencing at sunrise,
there will be a feast
tomorrow at the Cornucopia.
This will be no ordinary occasion,
each of you needs something
desperately
And we plan to be
generous hosts.
Your medicine.
You're not going alone.
Yeah, you need it and you can't walk.
Katniss, you're not gonna risk your
life for me. I'm not gonna let you.
You would do it for me,
wouldn't you?
Why are you doing this?
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.
Peeta!
Please.
Stay.
Okay.
I'll stay.
No!
Where's lover boy?
Oh I see.
You're gonna help him.
Well, that's sweet.
Well, it's too bad that you couldn't
help your little friend.
That little girl,
what was her name again?
Rue?
Yeah. Well, we killed her.
And now
We're gonna kill you.
You kill her?
No!
I heard you!
- Cato!
- You said her name!
You said her name!
You said her name!
Just this time twelve,
For Rue!
Peeta!
I got it.
I got the medicine.
What happened to you?
No, you're not. What happened?
The girl from two, she threw a knife.
but I'm okay.
You shouldn't have gone.
you said you weren't gonna go.
You got worse.
You need some of that too.
I'm okay.
That feels better.
Okay,
now you.
I'm okay.
No, come on. You need it too.
Come on.
Oh.
You're so much better.
Oh my God, Peeta.
I can hardly feel anything.
We could go home.
We could, with the only team left.
We could go home.
We know thresh took off.
Cato's gonna be by
the Cornucopia.
He's not gonna go
places he doesn't know.
Fox Face, she could be anywhere.
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.
Okay, uh, I'll take the bow.
I'm just kidding.
I'll locate some stuff.
Peeta?
Peeta?
Peeta?
Peeta?
Are you okay?
I heard the cannon!
That's nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!
I..,.. I didn't know.
You scared me to death.
Damn you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I never even knew she was
following me.
She was clever.
Too clever.
What're you doing?
Maybe Cato likes berries too?
What time is it?
A little after noon.
Why is it getting so dark?
They must be in a hurry to end it.
Ready, Lusia?
Oh right here sir!
That's great.
Can you put that in the middle?
Sure.
That's it.
That's Excellent.
Did you hear that?
What was that?
It's the finale.
Let's go.
Here.
Go on.
Shoot.
And we'd both go down and you'd win.
Go on.
I'm dead anyway.
I always was, right?
I didn't know that until now.
Isn't that what they want, huh?
Huh!
No!
I can still do this.
I can still do it.
One more kill.
It's the only thing I know how to do.
Bring pride to the district.
Not that it matters.
Please..,..!
Attention. Attention Tributes.
There has been a slight rule change.
The previous provision
allowing for two victors
from the same district
has been revoked.
Only one victor maybe crowned.
Goodluck.
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.
Go ahead.
One of us should go home!
One of us has to die.
They had to have their victor.
No.
They don't.
Why should they?
No!
Trust me.
Trust me.
Together?
Together.
Okay.
One..,..
Two..,..
Three..,..
Stop!
Stop!
Ladies and gentlemen.
May I present the winners
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
They're not happy with you.
Why? Because we didn't die?
Because you showed them up.
Well..
I'm sorry it didn't go the
way they planned.
You know I'm not very
happy with them either.
Katniss,
this is serious.
Not just for you.
They don't take this things lightly.
When they ask, you say you couldn't
help yourself.
You..,..you are so in love with this boy
that the thought
of not being with him was unthinkable.
You..,..you'd rather die than not be
with him. You understand?
How did you feel?
When you found him by that river?
I tought like the happiest
person in the world.
I couldn't imagine life without him.
And what about you, Peeta?
She just saved my life.
We saved each other.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The star crossed lovers,
from district 12, this
years victors of the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What a lovely pin.
Thank you, it's from my district.
They must be very proud of you.
So what happens when we get back?
I don't know.
I guess we try to forget.
I don't wanna forget.","polarity -0.017,subjectivity 0.282"

Our men in theMajor Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.Hey, Wuertz, mayor saysyou're closing in on the Batman.The investigation is ongoing.The process of cleaning upthe streets is a long one.I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...Ever intending to see your wife again,lieutenant?I thought you had togo look after your mother, detective.Checked her back into the hospital.I'm sorry.- So he hasn't shown up?- He often doesn't.- I like reminding everybody he's out there.- Why wouldn't he come?Hopefully......because he's busy.That's why we bring dogs.- My little princes.- Please.Please, they're crawling in my mouth.Please, I beg you, get them off.Look what your drugsdo to my customers.Buyer beware.I told you my compoundwould take you places.I never said they'd be placesyou wanted to go.My business, repeat customers.You don't like what I haveto offer, you can buy from someone else.Assuming Batman left anyoneto buy from.My dogs are hungry.Pity there's only one of you.- What...?- That's not him.Loose the dogs!That's more like it.Don't let me find you out here again.- We're trying to help you.- I don't need help.Not my diagnosis.What gives you the right?What's the difference between you and me?I'm not wearing hockey pads.Everybody back now!He can't resist showing us his face.What's he hiding under that makeup?Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?Him again. Who are the others?Another bunch of smalltimers.Some of the marked bills I gave you.My detectives have beenmaking drug buys with them.This bank was another drop for the Mob.That makes five.- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.- Time to move in.We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.SWAT teams, backup.What about this Joker guy?One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.When the new DA hears about this,he'll want in.- Do you trust him?- Be hard to keep him out.I hear he's as stubborn as you are.Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse......for not sleeping in a mansion.Whenever you stitch yourself up,you do make a bloody mess.Yeah. It makes me learnfrom my mistakes.You ought to be pretty knowledgeableby now, then.My armor.I'm carrying too much weight.I need to be... I need to be faster.I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.- Did you get mauled by a tiger?- It was a dog.It was a big dog.There were more copycats last night,Alfred, with guns.Why not hire them,take the weekend off?That wasn't exactlywhat I had in mind...- ...when I said I wanted to inspire people.- I know.But things have improved.Look at the new district attorney.I am, closely.Need to know if he can be trusted.Are you interested in his characteror his social circle?Who Rachel spends her time withis her business.I trust you don't have me followedon my day off.If you ever took one, I might.Know your limits, Master Wayne.Batman has no limits.- Well, you do, sir.- Well, can't afford to know them.And what's gonna happenon the day that you find out?We all know how much you like to say""I told you so.""On that day, Master Wayne,even I won't want to.Probably.Sorry I'm late, folks.- Where were you?- Worried you'd have to step up?- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.- Well, then......fair's fair.Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.Yeah? You wannaflip a coin to see who leads?My father's lucky coin. As I recall,it got me my first date with you.I wouldn't leave something like thatup to chance.I don't. I make my own luck.All rise.The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.I thought the DA justplayed golf with the mayor.Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough timeto put you away for life, Sally.With Carmine Falcone in Arkham......someone must have stepped upto run the so-called family.Is that man in this courtroom today?- Could you identify him for us, please?- You win, counselor.It was me.I have a sworn statement from youthat this man......Salvatore Maroni, is the new headof the Falcone crime family.Maroni? He's a fall guy.I'm the brains of the organization.- Order.- Permission to treat the witness as hostile?- Granted.- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.If you wanna kill a public servant,Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.- Get him out of here.- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.We'll never be able to link the gunto Maroni, so we can't charge him.But they're trying to kill you,means we're getting to them.I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.I'm fine, by the way.Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.You're not getting shot at,you're not doing your job right.But, you know......if you said you were rattled,we could take the rest of the day off.Can't. I dragged the head ofthe Major Crimes Unit down here.Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.Try to be nice.I hear you got a hell of a right cross.It's a shame Sal's going to walk.Yeah, well, good thing about the Mobis they keep giving you second chances.Lightly irradiated bills.Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?We liaise with various agencies...Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.Official policy is to arrest the vigilanteknown as Batman on sight.What about that floodlighton the top of MCU?If you got problemswith malfunctioning equipment......I suggest you take them upwith Maintenance, counselor.I've put every money laundererin Gotham behind bars......but the Mobis still getting its money out.I think you and your friendhave found the last game in town.You're trying to hit themwhere it hurts, their wallets.It's bold.You gonna count me in?In this town, the fewer people knowsomething, the safer the operation.I don't like that you gotyour own special unit......and it's full of copsI investigated at Internal Affairs.If I didn't work with copsyou'd investigated while at IA......I'd be working alone.I don't get political points for being anidealist. I do the best I can with what I have.You want me to back warrantsfor search and seizure on five banks......without telling me what we're after.I can give you the names of the banks.Well, that's a start.I'll get you your warrants,but I want your trust.Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.We all know you're Gotham's white knight.Yeah, well, I heard they havea different name for me down at MCU.I wouldn't know about that.In China, Lau Security Investmentsstands for dynamic new growth.A joint Chinese venture withWayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.Well, Mr. Lau......I speak for the rest of the board......and Mr. Wayne,in expressing our own excitement.Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious abouthow his trust fund gets replenished......but, frankly, this is embarrassing.You worry about the diligence,Mr. Reese.I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.It's done.The numbers are solid.Do them again.Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,now, would we?Another long night?This joint venture was your idea,and the consultants love it.But I'm not convinced.Lau's company has grown by8 percent annually like clockwork.His revenue streammust be off the books......maybe even illegal.Okay. Cancel the deal.You already knew.Just needed a closer look at their books.Anything else you can trouble me for?I need a new suit.Yeah. Three buttonsis a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,so much as function.You wanna be able to turn your head.Sure make backing outof the driveway easier.I'll see what I can do.Took three weeksto get a reservation here.I had to tell themI work for the government.- Really?- Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.Rachel. Fancy that.Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.- Natascha. Are you the prima...?- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.- Really? So you're into ballet?Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.The famous Bruce Wayne.Rachel's told me everything about you.I certainly hope not.- Let's put a couple tables together.- I'm not sure that they'll let us.Oh, they should. I own the place.How could you want to raise childrenin a city like this?- Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.- Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?Is...? Heh-heh.The Palisades? Sure.You know, as our new DA, you might wannafigure out where your jurisdiction ends.I'm talking about the kind of citythat idolizes a masked vigilante.Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizenstanding up for what's right.Gotham needs heroes like you,elected officials...- ...not a man who thinks he's above the law.- Who appointed the Batman?We did. All of us who stood byand let scum take control of our city.But this is a democracy, Harvey.When their enemies were at the gates......the Romans would suspend democracyand appoint one man to protect the city.It wasn't considered an honor,it was a public service.Harvey, the last man that they appointed toprotect the republic was named Caesar...- ...and he never gave up his power.- Okay, fine.You either die a hero......or you live long enoughto see yourself become the villain.Whoever the Batman is, he doesn'twanna do this for the rest of his life.How could he? Batman is looking forsomeone to take up his mantle.Someone like you, Mr. Dent?Maybe. If I'm up to it.What if Harvey Dentis the Caped Crusader? Hm?If I were sneaking out every night,someone would've noticed by now.Well, I'm sold, Dent,and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.That's nice, but I'm notup for reelection for three years.No, you don't understand.One fundraiser with my pals......you'll never need another cent.What the hell is this?As you're all aware,one of our deposits was stolen.A relatively small amount, 68 million.Who's stupid enough to steal from us?Two-bit wackjob,wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.He's not the problem. He's a nobody.The problem is our moneybeing tracked by the cops.Thanks to Mr. Maroni'swell-placed sources......we know that police have indeedidentified our banks using marked bills......and are planning toseize your funds today.And since the enthusiastic new DA hasput all my competitors out of business...- ...I'm your only option.- So, what are you proposing?Moving all deposits toone secure location, not a bank.- Where, then?- No one can know but me.If the police were to gain leverageover one of you......everyone's money would be at stake.What stop them getting to you?I go to Hong Kong,far from Dent's jurisdiction......and the Chinese will not extraditeone of their own.How soon can you move the money?I already have.For obvious reasons, I couldn't waitfor your permission.Rest assured, your money is safe.And I thought my jokes were bad.Give me one reason why I shouldn'thave my boy pull your head off.How about a magic trick?I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.Ta-da!It's...It's gone.Oh, and by the way,the suit, it wasn't cheap.- You ought to know, you bought it.- Sit.I want to hear proposition.Let's wind the clocks back a year.These cops and lawyerswouldn't dare cross any of you.I mean, what happened?Did your balls drop off? Hm?You see, a guy like me...- A freak.- Damn right.A guy like me... Look, listen.I know why you chooseto have your little, ahem......group-therapy sessionsin broad daylight.I know why you're afraidto go out at night.The Batman.See, Batman has shown Gothamyour true colors, unfortunately.Dent, he's just the beginning.And as for the television'sso-called plan......Batman has no jurisdiction.He'll find him and make him squeal.I know the squealers when I see them......and...What do you propose?It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.If it's so simple, why haven'tyou done it already?If you're good at something,never do it for free.How much you want?Uh, half.- You're crazy.- No, I'm not.No, I'm not.If we don't deal with this now......soon......little Gambol here won't be ableto get a nickel for his grandma.Enough from the clown!Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...- Shit!- ...this out of proportion.You think you can steal from usand just walk away?- Yeah.- I'm putting the word out.Five hundred grand for this clown dead.A million alive, so I can teach himsome manners first.All right. So, listen,why don't you give me a call......when you wanna start taking thingsa little more seriously?Here's my card.You're a hard man to reach.Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.If you'd have asked,I could have taken his passport.All that was left in the vaultswere marked bills.They knew we were coming.As soon as your office got involved...My office?You're sitting down there with scum likeWuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookiecold on a racketeering beat.Don't try and cloud the fact that clearlyMaroni's got people in your office, Dent.We need Lau back......but the Chinese won't extraditea national under any circumstances.If I get him to you,can you get him to talk?I'll get him to sing.We're going after the Mob's life savings.Things will get ugly.I knew the risk when I took this job,lieutenant.How will you get him back, any...?He does that.Our Chinese friends left townbefore I could tell them the deal was off.Well, I'm sure that you've always wantedto go to Hong Kong.What's wrong with a phone call?I think Mr. Lau deservesa more personal touch.Now, for high-altitude jumps, you'regoing to need oxygen and stabilizers.Well, I must say,compared to your usual requests......jumping out of an airplaneis pretty straightforward.What about getting back into the plane?- I'd recommend a good travel agent.- Without it landing.Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.The CIA had a program back in the '60s......for getting their people outof hot spots called Sky Hook.- We could look into that.- Yeah.Okay. Now...Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dippedtri-weave fibers for flexibility.You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.Perhaps you shouldread the instructions first?- Yeah.- Now, there is a tradeoff.Separation of the plates makes youmore vulnerable to knives and gunfire.We wouldn't wanna make thingstoo easy, now, would we?How will it hold up against dogs?We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?Should do fine against cats.I found one in Arizona.A very nice man said he could have it upand running in a week, and he takes cash.- What about the flight crew?- South Korean smugglers.They run flights into Pyongyang,below radar.- Did you think of an alibi?- Oh, yes.I believe this is your plane, sir.You look tired, Alfred.You'll be all right without me'?If you can tell me the Russian for""apply your own bloody suntan lotion.""Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.They say they've just killed the Joker.They brought the body.So, dead, that's 500.How about alive? Hm?You wanna know how I got these scars?My father was......a drinker......and a fiend.And one night,he goes off crazier than usual.Mommy gets the kitchen knifeto defend herself.He doesn't like that......not one bit.So, me watching......he takes the knife to her,laughing while he does it.He turns to me and he says:""Why so serious?""He comes at me with the knife.""Why so serious?""He sticks the blade in my mouth.""Let's put a smile on that face.""And...Why so serious?Now......our operation is small......but there is a lot of potential......for aggressive expansion.So which of you fine gentlemenwould like to join our team?Oh. There's only one spot open right now,so we're gonna have......tryouts.Make it fast.Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.Mr. Lau regrets he is unableto greet you in person today.I understand.For security purposes, I'm gonna have toask you to check in your mobile.Of course.I must apologize for leaving Gothamin the middle of our negotiations.This misunderstandingwith the Gotham police force...- ...I couldn't let it threaten my company.- Of course.A businessman of your staturewill understand and......with you here now, we can continue.Well, I do appreciate you bringing me outhere in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...We do not allow cell phones in here.I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.No, I really came to tell you thatour business deal has to be put on hold.You see, we can't affordto be seen to do business with......whatever it is you're accused of being.I'm sure a businessman of your staturewill understand.I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone callmight have sufficed.Mr. Wayne didn't want you to thinkhe was deliberately wasting your time.Just accidentally wasting it.That's very good, Mr. Lau.""Accidentally."" Very good.Hey, sir.There's a better view from the peak tram.How's the view from LSI Holdings?Restricted.Lau is holed up in there good and tight.- What's this?- I had R&D work it up.Sends out a high-frequency pulse......records the response timefor mapping an environment.Sonar. Just like a...Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.- And the other device?- It's in place.Mr. Wayne?Good luck.Look, give us the moneyand we'll talk about making a deal.The money is the only reasonI'm still alive.Oh, you mean, when they find out thatyou've helped us, they're gonna kill you?- Are you threatening my client?- No.I'm just assuming your client'scooperation with this investigation.As will everyone.No? Okay.Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.Wait!I won't give you the money......but I will give you my clients,all of them.You were a glorified accountant.What could you possibly haveon all of them that we could charge?I'm good with calculation.I handled all their investments.One big pot.Got it.One minute.RICO. If they pooled their money, we cancharge them as one criminal conspiracy.Charge them with what?In a RICO case, if you can chargeone of them with a felony...You can charge all of them with it.That's great.Mr. Lau.What kind of details do you haveabout this communal fund?- Ledgers...?- Immunity, protection...- ...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.- After you testify in open court.I'm just curious.With all your clients locked up......what's gonna happenwith all that money?Like I said, I'm good with calculation.He can't go to County.I'll keep him here in the holding cells.What is this, Gordon, your fortress?Well, you trust them over at County?I don't trust them here.Lau stays.Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travelarrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.Put word out. We hire the clown.He was right.We have to fix real problem.Batman.- I'm not aware of any participation...- Our boy looks good on the tube.You sure you wanna embarrass mein front of my friends?Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.Have a nice trip. See you next fall.Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.Eight hundred and forty-ninecounts of racketeering.Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.Five hundred and twenty-sevencounts of obstruction of justice.How do the defendants plead?Order in the court.Five hundred and forty-ninecriminals at once.How did you convince Surrilloto hear this farce?She shares my enthusiasm for justice.After all, she is a judge.Even if you blow enough smoketo get convictions out of Surrillo......you're gonna seta new record at appeals.It won't matter.The head guys make bail, sure.But the midlevel guys, they can't.They can't afford to be off the streets.They'll cut deals that include some jail time.Think of all you could dowith 18 months of clean streets.- Mr. Mayor, you can't...- No, get out. Both of you.Sit down.The public likes you.That's the only reason that this might fly.But that means it's on you.They're all gonna come after you now,and not just the Mob.Politicians, journalists, cops.Anyone whose wallet'sabout to get lighter.Are you up to it? You'd better be.Because they get anything on you......and those criminals are back on thestreets, followed swiftly by you and me.Jesus!I think your fundraiserwill be a great success, sir.And why do you think I wannahold a party for Harvey Dent?I assumed it was your usual reasonfor socializing beyond myself......and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:To try to impress Miss Dawes.Very droll, but very wrong.Actually, it's Dent.Police releasedvideo footage found concealed on the body.Sensitive viewers, be aware.The image is disturbing.Tell them your name.Brian Douglas.And are you the real Batman?- No.- No?- No.- No?Then why do you dress up like him?Because he's a symbol that wedon't have to be afraid of scum like you.Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.So you think Batman'smade Gotham a better place? Hm?Look at me.Look at me!You see, this is how crazyBatman's made Gotham.You want order in Gotham......Batman must take off his maskand turn himself in.Oh, and every day he doesn't,people will die.Starting tonight.I'm a man of my word.Harvey Dent,scourge of the underworld......scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.- I'll be back.- Rachel.A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?- Thank you. Alfred, right?- That's right, sir.Rachel talks about you all the time.You've known her her whole life.Not yet, sir.Any psychotic ex-boyfriendsI should be aware of?Oh, you have no idea.I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm gladto see that you all got started without me.Now, where is Harvey? Where...?Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.Where's Rachel Dawes?She is my oldest friend. Come here.When Rachel first told me she was datingHarvey Dent, I had one thing to say:""The guy from those God-awfulcampaign commercials?""""I believe in Harvey Dent.""Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.But it caught Rachel's attention.And then I started to pay attentionto Harvey......and all that he's been doingas our new DA.And you know what?I believe in Harvey Dent.I believe that on his watch,Gotham can feel......a little safer, alittle more optimistic.Look at this face. This is the faceof Gotham's bright future.To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.Harvey.Harvey may not know you well enoughto understand you're making fun of him...- ...but I do.- No, I meant every word.You know that daythat you once told me about......when Gotham would no longerneed Batman?- It's coming.- Bruce.- You can't ask me to wait for that.- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.He locked up half of the city's criminals,and he did it without wearing a mask.Gotham needs a hero with a face.You can throw a party, Wayne,I'll give you that.Thanks again.You mind if I borrow Rachel?Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to thebody? Forensics found three sets of DNA.- Any matches?- All three.The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.Tell Wuertz to find Dent.Protective custody.Where's the commissioner?- City hall.- Seal the building.- No one in or out till I get there.- Got it.Gordon. What are you up to?We're secure. I want a floor-by-floorsearch of the entire building.We believe the Joker'smade a threat against your life.These are dangerous people.- You're not giving me a lot of information.- Even we don't know where you're going.Take the envelope, get in, open it.It'll tell you where you're headed.You can't leave me alonewith these people.The whole Mob's after youand you're worried about these guys?Compared to this,the Mob doesn't scare me.Gordon, you're unlikely to discover thisfor yourself, so......take my word, the police commissionerearns a lot of threats.I found the appropriate responseto these situations a long time ago.Them gunning for youmakes you see things clearly.Yeah, I bet.Yeah. It makes you think about thingsyou couldn't stand losing......about who you wannaspend your life with.- That's a pretty big commitment.- Not if the Mob has their way.You get to explain to my wife......why I'm late for dinner.Sir, the joker cardhad traces of your DNA on it.- Don't do that.- All right.- Let's be serious, then.- Okay.What's your answer?I don't have an answer.How'd they get my DNA?Somebody with accessto your office or house......must have lifted a tissueor a glass... Wait! Wait!- Well, I guess no answer is a no.- Harvey.- It's someone else, isn't it?- Harvey.Just tell me it's not Wayne.The guy's a complete f...What are you doing?Oh, shit.Get a medic!They've come for him.We made it.Stay hidden.Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.We are tonight's entertainment.I only have one question:Where is Harvey Dent?You know where Harvey is?You know who he is?Hands up, pretty boy.Do you know where I can find Harvey?I need to talk to him.Just something little, huh? No.What's going on out there? Wayne!- Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.- Hey, wait...Oh, you gotta be kidding me.You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.We're not intimidated by thugs.You know......you remind me of my father.I hated my father.Okay, stop.Well, hello, beautiful.You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?And you are beautiful.You look nervous. Is it the scars?You wanna know how I got them?Come here. Hey.Look at me.So I had a wife.She was beautiful, like you......who tells me I worry too much......who tells me I ought to smile more......who gambles and gets in deepwith the sharks. Hey.One day they carve her face.And we have no money for surgeries.She can't take it.I just wanna see her smile again. Hm'?I just want her to knowthat I don't care about the scars.So......I stick a razor in my mouthand do this......to myself.And you know what?She can't stand the sight of me.She leaves.Now I see the funny side.Now I'm always smiling.You got a little fight in you. I like that.Then you're gonna love me.Drop the gun.Oh, sure. You just take off your little maskand show us all who you really are. Hm?Let her go.Very poor choice of words.Are you all right?Let's not do that again.- Is Harvey okay?- He's safe.Thank you.Jim, it's over.As long as they don't get to Lau,we've cut off their funds.The prosecution's over.Nobody's standing up in front of a judge......while judges and police commissionersare getting blown away.- What about Dent?- He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex...So where do you keep your trash?You're due in court. I need you alivelong enough to get you on the record.You can't protect me.You can't even protect yourselves.You refuse to cooperate, you're notcoming back here, you go to County.How long do you calculateyou'll last in there?Targeting me won't get their money.I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...- ...but this is different. They crossed a line.- You crossed the line first.You squeezed them, you hammered themto the point of desperation.And in their desperation, they turned toa man they didn't fully understand.Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.We just need to figure outwhat he's after.With respect, Master Wayne......perhaps this is a manyou don't fully understand either.A long time ago, I was in Burma......and my friends and I were workingfor the local government.They were trying to buythe loyalty of tribal leaders......by bribing them with precious stones......but their caravans were being raidedin a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.So we went looking for the stones.But in six months, we nevermet anyone who traded with him.One day, I saw a childplaying with a ruby......the size of a tangerine.The bandit had beenthrowing them away.- So why steal them?- Because he thought it was good sport.Because some men aren't lookingfor anything logical, like money.They can't be bought, bullied,reasoned or negotiated with.Some men just wannawatch the world burn.Your name, sir?Eighth and Orchard.You'll find Harvey Dent there.Check the names.""Richard Dent.""""Patrick Harvey.""Harvey Dent.I need 10 minutes with the scenebefore your men contaminate it.- It's because of you these guys are dead...- Detective!Give us a minute, guys.That's brick underneath.- Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?- No.Fingerprints.Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.Because we found his next target.He's put it in tomorrow's paper.I'm not sureyou made it loud enough, sir.What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?You wanted me to do the diligenceon the LSI Holdings deal again.Well, I found some irregularities.Their CEO is in police custody.No, not with their numbers, with yours.Applied Sciences. Whole division of WayneEnterprises just disappeared overnight.I went down to the archivesand I started pulling some old files.Don't tell me you didn't recognize your babypancaking cop cars on the evening news.Now you got the entire R&D Departmentburning through cash......claiming it's related tocell phones for the Army?What are you building for him now,a rocket ship?I want......$10 million a yearfor the rest of my life.Let me get this straight.You think that your client......one of the wealthiest, most powerful menin the world, is secretly a vigilante......who spends his nights beating criminalsto a pulp with his bare hands......and your planis to blackmail this person?Good luck.When...Keep that.This is your original scan.Here it is reengineered.And there's the thumbprint he leftwhen he pushed the round in the clip.I'll get you a copy.Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R&D?Yeah. Governmenttelecommunications project.Wasn't awarewe had any government contracts.You know, Lucius, I'm playing this onepretty close to the chest.Fair enough.With no word from the Batman,even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb......these cops have to wonder ifthe Joker will make good on his threat......in the obituary column ofThe Gotham Times to kill the mayor.I've checked all the databases.There are four possibles.Cross-reference the addresses.Look for Parkside,overlooking the parade.I got one.Melvin White,1502 Randolph Apartments.Aggravated assault,moved to Arkham twice.What do you got on the roof?We're tight, but frankly,there's a lot of windows up here.Commissioner Loeb dedicated his lifeto law enforcement......and to the protectionof his community.I remember when I first took office......and I asked if he wantedto stay on as commissioner.And he said he would, providedI kept my politics out of his office.Clearly he was not a man who mincedwords, nor should he have been.A number of policies that he enactedas commissioner were unpopular.Policies that flooded my officewith angry calls and letters...- Who's that?- What happened?They took our guns.And our uniforms.And as we recognize the sacrificeof this man......we must remember that vigilanceis the price of safety.Stand by. Honor guard.Attention. Port arms.Ready! Aim! Fire!Ready! Aim!Ready! Aim!Stay down! Don't move!Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.- I'll see you later.- Why are you going back?Get out of here.Tell me what you know about the Joker.No.I'm sorry, Barbara.Jimmy, go play with your sister.Go ahead, honey.If there's anything we can do,anything you need, we're here for you.Shh.Are you out there?Are you? You brought thiscraziness on us. You did!You brought this on us!Switch it off, he ain't coming.He doesn't wanna talk to us.God help whoever he does wanna talk to.Can't we go someplace quieter?We can't hear each other talk.What makes you thinkI wanna hear you talk?What?- Yeah?- Second.Okay.- Harvey, where are you?- Where are you?I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.- This is Gordon's unit.- Gordon's gone.- He vouched for these men.- And he's gone.The Joker's named you next.God, is there someone, is there anyonein this town we can trust?Bruce.We can trust Bruce Wayne.- No. Rachel, I know you're hisfriend, but... Harvey, trust me.Bruce's penthouse is nowthe safest place in the city.Then you go straight there.Don't tell anybodyand I'll find you there.I love you.I want the Joker.From one professional to another......you're trying to scare somebody,pick a better spot.From this height,the fall wouldn't kill me.I'm counting on it.- Where is he?- I don't know where he is. He found us.He must have friends.Friends? Have you met this guy?Someone knows where he is.Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.They're wise to your act.You got rules.The Joker, he's got no rules.Nobody's gonna cross him for you.If you want this guy, you got one way.But you already know what that is.Just take off that mask,let him come find you.Or you can let a couple more peopleget killed while you make up your mind.You wanna play games?How's that feel?- You wouldn't.- I wouldn't!You don't think I will?You don't think I will?No. No, I wouldn't.That's why I'm notgonna leave it up to me.Heads, you get to keep your head.Tails......not so lucky.So you wanna tell me about the Joker?- Let's go again.- I don't know anything! God, don't!You're not playing the odds, friend.Let's do it again.You'd leave a man's life to chance?- Not exactly.- His name's Schiff, Thomas.He's a paranoid schizophrenic,former patient at Arkham.The kind of mind the Joker attracts.What do you expect to learn from him?The Joker killed Gordon.He's gonna kill Rachel.You're the symbol of hopeI could never be.Your stand against organized crime......is the first legitimate ray of lightin Gotham in decades.If anyone saw this,everything would be undone.The criminals you arrestedwould be released......and Jim Gordonwill have died for nothing.You're gonna holda press conference tomorrow.- Why?- No one else will die because of me.Gotham's in your hands now.You can't.You can't give in.You can't give in!Harvey called.He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.I have no choice.You honestly think that's gonnakeep the Joker from killing people?Maybe not. But I have enough bloodon my hands.And I've seen now what I wouldhave to become to stop men like him.You once told me thatif the day came when I was finished......that we'd be together.Bruce, don't make meyour one hope for a normal life.Did you mean it?Yes.Bruce.If you turn yourself in,they're not gonna let us be together.- Logs as well?- Everything.Anything that could lead backto Lucius or Rachel.People are dying, Alfred.What would you have me do?Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.They'll hate you for it,but that's the point of Batman.He can be the outcast. He can makethe choice that no one else can make.The right choice.No, today I found outwhat Batman can't do.He can't endure this.Today you get to say ""I told you so.""Today, I don't want to.But I did bloody tell you.I suppose they're gonnalock me up as well......as your accomplice.Accomplice? I'm gonna tell themthe whole thing was your idea.Ladies and gentlemen, I've calledthis press conference for two reasons.Firstly, to assure the citizensof Gotham......that everything that can be doneover the Joker killings is being done.Secondly, because the Batmanhas offered to turn himself in.But let's consider the situation.Should we give into this terrorist's demands?Do we really think he's gonna...?You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilantethan the lives of citizens?The Batman is an outlaw.That's not why we demand he turn himselfin, we're doing it because we're scared.We've been happy to let Batmanclean up our streets till now.- Things are worse than ever!- Amen.Yes, they are.But the night is darkestjust before the dawn.And I promise you......the dawn is coming.One day, the Batman will have to answerfor the laws he's broken. But to us......not to this madman.- No more dead cops!- Yeah!He should turn himself in!- Give us the Batman! Come on!- Where is he?So be it. Take the Batman into custody.- What?- Is he here?I am the Batman.- What?- Come on.Alfred.Why is he letting Harvey do this?- He went down to the press conference.- I know. He just stood by.Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent......believe that Batman stands forsomething more important......than the whims of a terrorist,Miss Dawes......even if everyone hates him for it.That's the sacrifice he's making.He's not being a hero.He's being something more.Yeah, you're absolutely right.Letting Harvey take the fall for thisis not heroic at all.You know him better than anyone.I do.Will you give this to him for me?When the time is right?How will I know?It's not sealed.Goodbye, Alfred.Bye, Rachel.I didn't have time to talk this through.- What are you doing?- They're transferring me to Central Holding.This is the Joker's chance, and when heattacks, the Batman will take him down.Listen. This is too dangerous.We get this guy to County, he's theirproblem. The streets will be cleared......so let's go.The convoys stop for no reason.I hope you got some moves, pal.He's using you as bait. He doesn't know ifhe can get the Joker. He's failed so far.- How do you know what he's thinking?- I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you.What about the people depending on you toclean the city up and do it honorably and...?Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.Heads, I go through with it.This is your life. You can'tleave something like that to chance.I'm not.You make your own luck.Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.What the hell is that?Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!Damn it! All units divert downonto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.Exit down!Lower Fifth? We'll belike turkeys on Thanksgiving.Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.Let's go.Listen, we need backup.We've got company.We got trouble, guys.Lock and load!The hell was that?- These are built for that, right?- He'll need something......a lot bigger to get through this.What is that?What is that, a bazooka?I didn't sign up for this!Look out.Look out!Come on, let's go!Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.Scanning all systems.Scanning all systems.We gotta get topside.We need air support, now!I like this job. I like it.Damage catastrophic.Eject sequence initiated.Goodbye.We're on point, ready to give themsome of their own medicine.That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.Okay, rack them up.Rack them up, rack them up,rack them up.That's not good.Okay, that's not good!Now, there's a Batman.Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.Come on.He missed!You can't stop here.We're like sitting ducks!Come on, come on.Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,I want you to do it. Come on!Come on.Come on. I want you to do it,I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!Hit me!Come on, come on.Could you please just give me a minute?We got you, you son of a bitch.Gor... You do like to play thingspretty close to the chest.We got him, Harvey.Mr. Dent! How does it feelto be the biggest hero in Gotham?No, I'm no hero.Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.But you and your office havebeen working with the Batman all along.- No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.- Which was?Saving my ass.All right, people, that's enough.Let him be. Let him be.Thank you, detective.I've got a datewith a pretty upset girlfriend.- I figured, counselor.- Mr. Dent, sir...- ...how about one for the front page, sir?- Mr. Dent.Stand away! All of you!I don't want anything for his Mob lawyerto use, you understand?Back from the dead.I, uh......couldn't risk my family's safety.What do we got?Nothing. No matches on prints,DNA, dental.Clothing is custom, no labels.Nothing in his pocketsbut knives and lint.No name.- No other alias.- Go home, Gordon.The clown'll keep till morning.Go get some rest.You're gonna need it.Tomorrow you take the big job.You don't have any say in the matter.Commissioner Gordon.I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.Look at these ugly bastards.- I don't feel good.- You're a cop killer.You're lucky to be feeling anythingbelow the neck.- Please!- Step away from the bars!My insides hurt.Did Batman save you, Daddy?Actually, this time......I saved him.Has he said anything yet?Evening, commissioner.Harvey Dent never made it home.- Of course not.- What have you done with him?Me?I was right here.Who did you leave him with?Hm? Your people?Assuming, of course,that they are still your people......and not Maroni's.Does it depress you, commissioner......to know just how alone you really are?Does it make you feel responsiblefor Harvey Dent's current predicament?- Where is he?- What's the time?What difference does that make?Well, depending on the time,he may be in one spot or several.If we're gonna play games......I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.Ah, the ""good cop, bad cop"" routine?Not exactly.Never start with the head. The victimgets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...See?You wanted me. Here I am.I wanted to see what you'd do.And you didn't disappoint.You let five people die.Then you let Dent take your place.- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.- Where's Dent?Those Mob fools want you gone sothey can get back to the way things were.But I know the truth. There's nogoing back. You've changed things.- Forever.- Then why do you wanna kill me?I don't wanna kill you.What would I do without you?Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.No. No, you...You complete me.- You're garbage who kills for money.- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.Even if you'd like to be.To them, you're just a freak......like me.They need you right now......but when they don't......they'll cast you out like a leper.You see, their morals, their code......it's a bad joke.Dropped at the first sign of trouble.They're only as good as the worldallows them to be. I'll show you.When the chips are down, these...These civilized people......they'll eat each other.See, I'm not a monster.I'm just ahead of the curve.Where's Dent?You have all these rules,and you think they'll save you.- He's in control.- I have one rule.Oh. Then that's the rule you'llhave to break to know the truth.Which is?The only sensible way to liveis without rules.And tonight you're gonna breakyour one rule.I'm considering it.There's only minutes left,so you'll have to play my game......if you wanna save one of them.""Them""?You know, for a while there,I thought you really were Dent.The way you threw yourself after her.Look at you go.Does Harvey knowabout you and his little bunny?Where are they?!Killing is making a choice.- Where are they?!- Choose between one life or the other.Your friend the district attorney,or his blushing bride-to-be.You have nothing,nothing to threaten me with.Nothing to do with all your strength.Don't worry, I'm gonna tell youwhere they are, both of them.And that's the point.You'll have to choose.He's at 25052nd Street......and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.- Which one you going after?- Rachel.We're getting Dent!25052nd Street!Hello?Can anybody hear me?Hello!- Rachel?- Harvey.Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?I'm all right. I'm in a...I'm in a warehouse.They got me wired to these oil drums.I am too.Harvey.I want my phone call.I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.That's nice.How many of your friends have I killed?I'm a 20-year man......and I know the difference betweenpunks who need a lesson in manners......and the freaks like youwho would just enjoy it.And you killed six of my friends.Six?Please. My insides hurt.I don't really care. Back away.The boss said he'd make the voicesgo away.He said he'd go insideand replace them with bright lights......like Christmas.You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.Medic to the holding tank.Come on. Get the door open.You guys, back off!Listen, we don't have a lot of time.They told me that only one of uswas gonna make it......and that they were gonnalet our friends choose.Okay, Rachel.It's gonna be fine. It's gonna beall right. They're coming for you.Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk methrough what's going on with you.- Can you find something, anything, sharp?- I'm trying.- What's...?- Shit.Harvey?Harvey, what's happening?All available units,converge at 25052nd Street.Do you wanna know why I use a knife?Guns are too quick.You can't savor all the......little emotions.You see, in their last moments......people show you who they really are.So in a way, I knew your friendsbetter than you ever did.Would you like to knowwhich of them were cowards?- What's that?- Jeez.He's got some kind of a...- ...contusion.- I know you're gonna enjoy this.I'm gonna have to try and enjoy iteven more.Just put it down.Take it easy. Take it easy.Drop the weapon now!- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!- Let him go now! Drop it!- What? Sorry?- What do you want?I just want my phone call.What...? What...? What's happening?Just talk to me, just for one second.- All right?- Right.Is that a phone?Mount the curb!Harvey, just in case,I wanna tell you something, okay?Don't think like that. They're coming.I know they are,but I don't want them to.I don't wanna live without you,and I do have an answer for you.My answer is yes.No! No! No!Not me! Why are you coming for me?No!Rachel! Rachel!Harvey.- No! No! Rachel!Okay.Rachel!No! No!Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.Somewh...No, commissioner!Rachel! No!Hello there.Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.With Lau?The Joker planned to be caught.He wanted me to lock him upin the MCU.Dear Bruce:I need to be honest and clear.I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.I love him, and I wanna spendthe rest of my life with him.When I told you that if Gotham no longerneeded Batman, we could be together......I meant it.But now I'm sure the day won't comewhen you no longer need Batman.I hope it does.And if it does, I will be there......but as your friend.I'm sorry, Harvey.I'm sorry to let you down.If you lose your faith in me,please keep your faith in people.Love, now and always, Rachel.Prepared a little breakfast.- Very well, then.- Alfred.Yes, Master Wayne?Did I bring this on her?I was meant to inspire good......not madness, not death.You have inspired good. But you spatin the faces of Gotham's criminals.Didn't you thinkthere might be casualties?Things always get worsebefore they get better.But Rachel, Alfred.Rachel believed in what you stood for......what we stand for.Gotham needs you.No, Gotham needs its true hero......and I let that murdering psychopathblow him half to hell.Which is why, for now......they're gonna have tomake do with you.She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.Dent doesn't know.He can never know.What's that?- It can wait.- That bandit......in the forest in Burma.- Did you catch him?- Yes.How?We burned the forest down.He's credible, an M&A lawyerfrom a leading consultancy.He says he's waited as long as he canfor Batman to do the right thing.Now he's taking mattersinto his own hands.We'll be live at 5 withthe true identity of the Batman.I'm sorry about Rachel.The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,but that you won't accept medication.That you're refusing to......accept skin grafts.Remember that name......you all had for me......when I was at Internal Affairs?What was it, Gordon?Harvey, I...Say it.Say it!Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.Why should I hide who I am?I know you tried to warn me.I'm sorry.Wuertz picked you up.Was he working for them?Do you know who picked up Rachel?Harvey, I need to knowwhich of my men I can trust.Why would you listen to me now?I'm sorry, Harvey.No.No, you're not.Not yet.This craziness, it's too much.Should've thought about thatbefore you let the clown out of the box.You want him?I can tell youwhere he'll be this afternoon.Not so crazy as you look.I told you, I'm a man of my word.Where is the Italian?All tactical units will convergeon the location in 20 minutes.I want auxiliary units to coverall possible getaway routes.Please.Joker-man, what you dowith all your money?You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.I enjoy......dynamite......and gunpowder......and gasoline.What the...?And you know the thingthat they have in common?They're cheap.How much are theypaying you to say who Batman is?This is our chance. I want Lau alive.The Joker, either way.Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.Let's take the next caller.Harvey Dent didn't wannagive in to this maniac.You think you know better?I think that if we could talk toDent today, he may feel differently.And we wish him a speedy recovery.Because God knows, we need him now.You said you were a man of your word.Oh, I am.I'm only burning my half.All you care about is money.This town deservesa better class of criminal......and I'm gonna give it to them.Tell your men they work for me now.This is my city.They won't work for a freak.""Freak.""Why don't wecut you up into little pieces......and feed you to your pooches? Hm?And then we'll see how loyala hungry dog really is.It's not about money......it's about sending a message.Everything burns.Who is this?I had a vision......of a world without Batman.The Mob ground out a little profit......and the police tried to shut them downone block at a time.And it was so boring.I've had a change of heart.I don't want Mr. Reesespoiling everything......but why should I have all the fun?Let's give someone else a chance.If Coleman Reeseisn't dead in 60 minutes......then I blow up a hospital.Call in every officer.Tell them to head to their nearest hospitaland start evac and search.Call the transit authority, school board,prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.The priority is Gotham General. Wheeleverybody out of that place right now.You, you and you, you come with me.- Where are we going, sir?- To get Reese.I need you plugged in,checking Gordon's men and their families.- Looking for?- Hospital admissions.Will you be wanting the Batpod?In the middle of the day?Not very subtle.The Lamborghini, then.Much more subtle.Excuse me. Let me through.Excuse me. Okay.Sir, could you help, please?I'm gonna find a bus for him.Sir? Commissioner, do you really think......an ordinary citizenwould try to kill this man?Sir. Commissioner.Get the cars around the back!Go. Keep rolling, Sam.I see O'Brien and Richards.No immediate family memberadmitted to a Gotham hospital.- They're trying to kill me.- Well, maybe Batman can save you.Davis, they got space. Bring him out.Davis.I saw Burns and Zachary.Nothing on them.And a patrolman I don't know.Okay, so, what now?What do we do now?Where are we going?Send the information to Gordon.Get out of here.Davis.Ma'am, we're gonna have tomove him now.- It's Berg, isn't it?- Commissioner.You okay, son?Hi.You know......I don't want there to beany hard feelings between us, Harvey.- When you and...- Rachel!...Rachel were being abducted......I was sitting in Gordon's cage.I didn't rig those charges.Your men, your plan.Do I really look like a guy with a plan?You know what I am?I'm a dog chasing cars.I wouldn't know what to do with oneif I caught it.You know? I just do things.The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.Gordon's got plans.You know, they're schemers.Schemers trying to controltheir little worlds.I'm not a schemer.I try to show the schemers......how pathetic their attemptsto control things really are.So when I say... Ah. Come here.When I say that you and your girlfriendwas nothing personal......you'll know that I'm telling the truth.- I'm gonna need your weapon.- What?Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?Yeah, that'd be why.It's the schemersthat put you where you are.You were a schemer, you had plans......and look where that got you.Police are taking every precaution......urging people not totake matters into their hands.I just did what I do best.I took your little planand I turned it on itself.Look what I did to this city witha few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.Hm? You know what I noticed?Nobody panics whenthings go ""according to plan.""Even if the plan is horrifying.If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,a gangbanger will get shot......or a truckload of soldierswill be blowing up......nobody panics.Because it's all part of the plan.But when I say thatone little old mayor will die......well, then, everyone loses their minds.Introduce a little anarchy......upset the established order......and everything becomes chaos.I'm an agent of chaos.Oh, and you know the thingabout chaos?It's fair.You live.You die.Now we're talking.Mr. Reese.That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?- That was a very brave thing you did.- Trying to catch the light?- You weren't protecting the van?- Why? Who's in it?Don't you thinkI should go to the hospital?Don't watch a whole lot of news,do you, Mr. Wayne?Southeast.It's Gotham General.- Did you clear the building?- Yeah.You must know how many were inside.You have patient lists, roll call.Right now we're showing50 people missing. One bus.The other buses were heading off tohospitals. I guess we missed one.What's your guessabout where Harvey Dent is?Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.Anybody asks, we got him out.Get me the mayor's office on the line.We're gonna need the National Guard....people are stillmissing, including GCN's own Mike Engel.I'm now being told that we're cutting toa video GCN has just received.I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.""What does it taketo make you people wanna join in?""You failed to kill the lawyer.I've gotta get you off the bench......and into the game.Bench. Game.- Come nightfall, this city is mine.- Mine.- And anyone left here plays by my rules.- Rules.Mr. Fox? Security is showinga break-in at the R&D Department.If you don't wanna be in the game...- ...get out now.- Get out now.But the bridge-and-tunnel crowdare sure in for a surprise.Ha-ha, ha-ha.- Gotham P.D. has shut down...- Sweet Jesus....the area's bridges and tunnels.Shouldn't you be out there,you know, doing something?It's my day off.I gotta take a leak.Keep an eye out for me, will you?Now what?Need someone to shake it for you?Hello.Dent.Jesus. I thought you was dead.Half.Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?- It must've been Maroni's men.- Shut up!Are you telling me that you're gonnaprotect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?I don't know, he never told me.Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't knowwhat they were gonna do to you.That's funny......because I don't knowwhat's gonna happen to you either.Beautiful, isn't it?Beautiful.Unethical.Dangerous.You've turned every cell phone in Gothaminto a microphone.And a high-frequency generator-receiver.You took my sonar conceptand applied it to every phone in the city.With half the city feeding you sonar,you can image all of Gotham.This is wrong.I've gotta find this man, Lucius.At what cost?The database is null-key encrypted.It can only be accessed by one person.This is too much power for one person.That's why I gave it to you.Only you can use it.Spying on 30 million peopleisn't part of my job description.This is an audio sample. If he talkswithin range of any phone in the city......you can triangulate his position.I'll help you this one time.But consider this my resignation.As long as this machine isat Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.When you're finished......type in your name.My officers are going overevery inch of the tunnels and bridges......but with the Joker's threat,they're not an option.- And land routes east?- Backed up for hours.Which leaves the ferrieswith 30,000 ready to board.I wanna use the ferries so I canget those prisoners off the island.The men you put away?Those aren't people I'm worried about.You should be.Whatever the Joker's planning......it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners areinvolved. I wanna get them out of here.So where is Harvey?- We haven't found him.- Oh, Jesus.How long can you keep this quiet?Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.Going to join your wife?- You love her?- Yes.You ever imagine what it would be liketo listen to her die?Look, take it up with the Joker.He killed your woman. He made you......like this.The Joker's just a mad dog.I want whoever let him off the leash.I took care of Wuertz, but who wasyour other man inside Gordon's unit?Who picked up Rachel?Must have been someone she trusted.Look, if I tell you......will you let me go?Can't hurt your chances.It was Ramirez.- But you said...- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.You're a lucky man.- But he's not.- Who?Your driver.Stand back.Hey, that ain't right.We should be on that boat.You wanna ride acrosswith them? Be my guest.Sir, they've stopped their engines.Right, get on the radio.Tell them we'll come back and pick them uponce we dump the scumbags.Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.What the heck was that?What the...?Liberty, come in,please. This is Spirit. Come in.Liberty, we have the same thing.We've lost both engines.- Liberty, come in.- Fox.There's something going onon the ferries.Get down to the engine room now.Hey, buddy, what's happening?Captain, we got a hundred barrelsdown there rigged to blow. And this.Oh, my God.Looks like some kind of detonator.Why would they give usthe detonator to our own bomb?Tonight, you're allgonna be a part of a social experiment.Through the magic of diesel fueland ammonium nitrate......I'm ready right nowto blow you all sky-high.Liberty, come 'm, over.It's dead.If anyone attemptsto get off their boat, you all die.I'm zeroing in.Each of you has a remoteto blow up the other boat.His voice is on the ferry......but it's not the source.West.I have the Joker's location.Prewitt Building.Assemble on the building opposite.At midnight, I blow you all up.If, however, one of you presses the button,I'll let that boat live.So who's it gonna be?Harvey Dent's most-wantedscumbag collection......or the sweet and innocent civilians?You choose.Oh, and you might wannadecide quickly......because the people on the other boatmay not be quite so noble.Stay back.Well, now, who are you to decide?We ought to talk this over, at least.We don't all have to die.Those men had their chance.- We are not going to talk about this.- Why aren't we talking about it?They're talking over the same thingon the other boat.- Let's put it to a vote.- Yes!- Hello?- Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.Jim needs you to pack upand put the kids in the car right away.But the units outside...Those cops can't be trusted.Jim needs you away from themas soon as possible.I'll call them off for 10 minutes,and you'll have to move fast.- But where am I supposed to take them?125052nd Sweet.- Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.- Okay.She believe you?It's because she trusts you......just like Rachel did.- I didn't know...- Didn't know what they'd do?You're the second cop to say that to me.What exactly did you thinkthey were gonna do?They got me early on.My mother's hospital bills...- Don't!- I'm sorry.You live to fight another day, officer.We found the missing hospital bus.Then we have a hostage situation.It's a shooting gallery.Why would he choose a spotwith such big windows?We have clear shots on five clowns.Snipers take them out,smash the windows, a team rappels in.Team moves in by the stairwells.Two, three casualties max.- Let's do it.- It's not that simple.- With the Joker, it never is.- What's simple is......every second, those people on theferries get closer to blowing...- That won't happen.- Then he'll blow both of them up!- We don't have time for paper ballots.- I want everybody to put their votes......on this piece of paper.If anyone's got pens, pass it along.Thank you. Anybody else?Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.We need to get these votes in quickly.Come on.What are you waiting for?Push the button!We're running out of time!I need five minutes alone.No! There's no time!We have clear shots!Dent is in there with them.We have to save Dent!I have to save Dent.Get ready.Two minutes, then we breach.Fox, I need picture.- Hello?- Jim, we're in trouble.Okay, you got POV on alpha......omni on beta.Looks like clowns and hostageson two floors.There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.Another SWAT team on the roof.Line's clear.- Barbara, calm down.- He has the kids!- Hello, Jim.- Harvey?- Where's my family?- Where my family died.Blue team, acquire the target.Entry team, set your charge.Fox, the SWATs are targeting thewrong people. The clowns are the hostages.Red team, go! Red team, go!Entry team, blow and go!Don't move.Take the shot.Those SWATs are coming in hot.Clowns, put down your guns.- Drop your weapons!- On the ground, now!Doctors, get down!Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...Freeze!Stand down or you will be...Look up.See those bad guys on the floor above?They're waiting to ambush the SWAT teamcoming up the elevator.Sixty seconds.The tally is 140 against, 396 for.So go ahead. Do it.We're still here.And that means they haven'tkilled us yet either.Go, go, go!Blue team, cover!Trouble on the floor above.Get down on the ground now!Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.We will shoot you. Drop the officer.- Release the officer right now.- Let him go now! On your knees!We got him. He's out of the game.- Keep your hands in the air!- Step away from the edge!Halt!- Stay down!- Don't move!Be advised.Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.- Where's the detonator?- Go get him.- Put down your weapon!- Don't move!You don't wanna die......but you don't know how to take a life.Give it to me.These men will kill youand take it anyway.No one wants to get their hands dirty.Fine. I'll do it.Those men on that boat?They made their choices.They chose to murder and steal.It doesn't make any sensefor us to have to die too.All the old familiar places.Stand by.Red team, floor secure.Hostages are safe.Give it to me.You can tell them I took it by force.Give it to me, and I'll do whatyou should've did 10 minutes ago.We really should stop this fighting,otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.There won't be any fireworks.And here we go.What were you trying to prove?That deep down,everyone's as ugly as you?You're alone.Can't rely on anyone these days.You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?That's okay. I came prepared.It's a funny world we live in. Speaking ofwhich, you know how I got these scars?No, but I know how you got these.Oh, you.You just couldn't let me go, could you?This is what happenswhen an unstoppable force......meets an immovable object.You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?Huh? You won't kill me......out of some misplaced senseof self-righteousness.And I won't kill you......because you're just too much fun.I think you and I are destinedto do this forever.You'll be in a padded cell forever.Maybe we could share one.You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate thiscity's inhabitants are losing their minds.This city just showed you......that it's full of peopleready to believe in good.Until their spirit breaks completely.Until they get a good lookat the real Harvey Dent......and all the heroic things he's done.You didn't think I'd risk losing the battlefor Gotham's soul......in a fistfight with you?No.You need an ace in the hole.Mine's Harvey.What did you do?I took Gotham's white knight......and I brought him down to our level.It wasn't hard.See, madness, as you know......is like gravity.All it takes is a little push.Dent!This is where they brought her,Gordon, after your men handed her over.This is where she died.I know, I was here...- ...trying to save her.- But you didn't.- I couldn't.- Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.If you stood up against corruption......instead of doing your dealwith the devil.I was trying to fight the Mob!You wouldn't dare try to justify yourselfif you knew what I'd lost.Have you ever had to talk to the personyou loved most......tell them it's gonna be all right,when you know it's not'?Well, you're about to knowwhat that feels like, Gordon.Then you can look me in the eyeand tell me you're sorry.- You're not going to hurt my family.- No.Just the person you love most.So is it your wife?Put the gun down, Harvey.Harvey, put down the gun.Please. Please, Harvey. Please.Oh, goddamn it.Will you stop pointing that gunat my family?- No!- We have a winner.No, Jim, stop him!- Harvey.- Don't let him...Harvey!I'm sorry!For everything.Please don't hurt my son.You brought your cops?All they know is there's a situation.They don't know who or what.They're just creating a perimeter.You think I wanna escape from this?There is no escape from this.You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.It's not about what I want,it's about what's fair!You thought we could be decent menin an indecent time.But you were wrong.The world is cruel. And the only moralityin a cruel world......is chance.Unbiased.Unprejudiced.Fair.His son's got the same chance she had.Fifty-fifty.What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.We decided to act.We three.Then why was it me who wasthe only one who lost everything?- It wasn't.- The Joker chose me.Because you were the best of us.He wanted to prove thateven someone as good as you......could fall.And he was right.You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.So point it at the people responsible.Fair enough.You first.My turn.Harvey, you're right.Rachel's death was my fault.Please don't punish the boy.- Please, punish me.- I'm about to.Tell your boyhe's gonna be all right, Gordon.Lie......like I lied.It's going to be all right, son.Dad? Daddy, is he okay?- Thank you.- You don't have to thank me.Yes, I do.The Joker won.Harvey's prosecution,everything he fought for...undone.Whatever chance you gave us at fixingour city dies with Harvey's reputation.We bet it all on him.The Joker took the best of usand tore him down.People will lose hope.They won't.They must never know what he did.Five dead.- Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...- No.But the Joker cannot win.Gotham needs its true hero.- No.- You either die a hero......or you live long enoughto see yourself become the villain.I can do those things......because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.I killed those people.That's what I can be.No, no, you can't. You're not.I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.Call it in.A hero.Not the hero we deserved,but the hero we needed.Nothing less than a knight......shining.They'll hunt you.You'll hunt me.You'll condemn me.Set the dogs on me.Because that's what needs to happen.Because sometimes......the truth isn't good enough.Sometimes people deserve more.Sometimes people deserveto have their faith rewarded.Batman.Batman!Why's he running, Dad?Because we have to chase him.Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!He didn't do anything wrong.Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,but not the one it needs right now.So we'll hunt him......because he can take it.Because he's not a hero.He's a silent guardian......a watchful protector.A dark knight.","polarity 0.102,subjectivity 0.634"

Just standard procedure.Bloody waste of my time is what I call it.I'm sorry to have to deal with sucha delicate subject at our first encounter.But, um...I have to be frank with you.I think that would be a good idea.The Prime Minister's concerned.Well, you can tell him my operatives are pursuing every avenue.Have you considered pulling out the agents?I've considered every option.Forgive me, that sounds like an evasion.Forgive me, but why am I here?Three months ago, you lost the computer drive containing the identityof almost every NATO agent embedded interrorist organizations across the globe.A list which, in the eyes of our allies, never existed.So if you'll forgive me, I think you know why you're here.Are we to call this ""civilian oversight""?No, we're to call this ""retirement planning.""Your country has only the highest respect for youand your many years of service.When your current posting is completed,you'll be awarded GCMG with full honors.Congratulations.You're firing me.No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee the transition periodleading to your voluntary retirement in two months' time.Your successor has yet to be appointed, so we'll be asking you...I'm not an idiot, Mallory.I know I can't do this job foreverbut I'll be damned if I'm going to leave the departmentin worse shape than I found it.M, you've had a great run.You should leave with dignity.Oh, to hell with dignity. I'll leave when the job's done.Yes?Now?Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.We're tracing the encryption signal.Localizing now.Centering in the UK.London.Get us back to base as soon as possible.It's coming from Ml6.What?The data packet is linking to our network.Correction. This is behind our firewall.We should shut down.No, track it.We have to know where it's coming from.Strip the headers. Trace the source.How the hell did they get into our system?Getting trace back now.It appears...It appears to be your computer, ma'am.Shut it down.What is this?For God's sake!Just get out of the way!- Don't you recognize the car?- Madam.Oh... !This is CNN Breaking News.Emergency crews are still attempting to assessthe damage as investigators hunt for leadsin what now appears to be a majorterrorist attack in the heart of London.No-one has yet claimed responsibility for what sources are callinga possible ""cyber-terrorist assault"" on the British Secret Service.Early reports from the scene indicateat least six dead, many more injured,with victims being evacuated to local hospitalswithin minutes of the explosion.It's time to go, ma'am.I'm going to find whoever did this.Where the hell have you been?Enjoying death.007 reporting for duty.Why didn't you call?You didn't get the postcard?You should try it some time. Get away from it all.It really lends perspective.Ran out of drink where you were, did they?What was it you said?""Take the bloody shot.""I made a judgment call.You should have trusted me to finish the job.It was the possibility of losing youor the certainty of losing all those other agents.I made the only decision I could and you know it.I think you lost your nerve.What do you expect, a bloody apology?You know the rules of the game.You've been playing it long enough.We both have.Maybe too long.Speak for yourself.Ronson didn't make it, did he?No.So this is it.We're both played out.Well, if you believe that, why did you come back?Good question.Because we're under attack.And you know we need you.Well, I'm here.You'll have to be debriefed and declared fit for active service.You can only return to duty when you've passed the tests,so take them seriously.And a shower might be in order.I'll go home and change.Oh, we've sold your flat, put your things into storage.Standard procedure on the death of an unmarried employeewith no next of kin.You should have called.I'll find a hotel.Well, you're bloody well not sleeping here.The assailant hacked into the environmental control system,locked out the safety protocolsand turned on the gas, all of which should have been impossible.On top of that, they hacked into her files.They knew her appointments, knew she'd be out of the building.They weren't targeting her.They wanted her to see it.Where are we, Tanner?New digs.The old building was declared ""strategically vulnerable"".That's putting it mildly.He was able to breach the most secure computer system in Britain.So we're on war footing now.This was part of Churchill's bunker.We're still discovering tunnelsdating back to the 18th Century.Quite fascinating, if it wasn't for the rats.When do I see M?Tomorrow you'll see M and Mallory, too, if you're lucky.Who's Mallory?The new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee.Charming man. I think you and heare really going to hit it off.Welcome to the new MI6.We've attempted to trace the computer message, butit was sent by an asymmetrical security algorithm,which bounced the signal all over the globethrough over a thousand different servers.And now that they've accessed M's codes,it's only a matter of time before they're able to decrypt the list.Q-Branch have been analyzing the picture but so far nothing.The general feeling is it's probably someone from her past.Perhaps when she was running things in Hong Kong.She's no idea what it all means.You believe that?The truth is, we don't have a clue who took the listor what they plan to do with it.We can always do this later.You know what? Let's.I'd like to start with some simple word associations.Just tell me the first word that pops into your head.For example, I might say ""Day"" and you might say...Wasted.All right.Gun.- Shot.- Agent.Provocateur.Woman.Provocatrix.Heart.Target.Bird.Sky.M.Bitch.Sunlight.Swim.- Moonlight.- Dance.Murder.Employment.- Country.- England.Skyfall.Skyfall.Done.Well, this is going well.Get these analyzed.For her eyes only.She's ready for you.I'm sorry, have we met before?I'm the one who should say ""sorry"".It was only four ribs.Some of the less vital organs.Nothing major.Not enough excitement in Istanbul?I've been reassigned.Temporary suspension from field work.- Really?- Mmm.Something to do with killing 007.Well, you gave it your best shot.That was hardly my best shot.I'm not sure I could survive your best.I doubt you'll get the chance.Well, do me a favor, will you? If they do ever let you back out there,warn me first.I'm assisting Gareth Mallory in the transition,and then I'll be back in the field.That's what you want?Yes, of course.It's not for everyone.Ah, 007. It's this way.In your defense, a moving target is much harder to hit.Then you better keep moving.The whole office goes up in smokeand that bloody thing survives.Your interior decorating tips have always been appreciated, 007.007, Gareth Mallory.I hope I haven't missed anything.The PM does prattle on in a crisis.Bond.Mallory.I've just been reviewing Bond's tests.It seems you've passed... by the skin of your teeth.You're back on active service.Congratulations.Thank you.I'll, um...I'll be outside.I only have one question.Why not stay dead?You have the perfect way out. Go and live quietly somewhere.Not many field agents get to leave this cleanly.Do you get out in the field much?You don't need to be an operative to see the obvious.It's a young man's game.Look, you've been seriously injured.There's no shame in saying you've lost a step.The only shame would be not admitting it until it's too late.Hire me or fire me. It's entirely up to you.If he says he's ready, he's ready.Perhaps you can't see it, or maybe you won't.What exactly are you implying?You're sentimental about him.As long as I'm head of this department, I'll choose my own operatives.Fair enough.Good luck, 007.Don't cock it up.We've analyzed the shrapnel fragments.You're lucky it wasn't a direct hitor it would have cut you in half.It's a depleted uranium shell. Military grade.Hard to get, extremely expensive,and only used by a select few.Recognize anyone?Him.Okay. Name's Patrice.He's a ghost. No known residence or country of origin.So how do we find him?Well, luckily, we still have one or two friends left in the CIA.They're after him for the Yemeni ambassador's murder,and they're getting close.Intel is he's going to be in Shanghaiin two days time, probably on a job.You're to go there and await further instructions.If he turns up, he's yours.Find out who he works for and who has the list.Then terminate him, for Ronson.With pleasure.Is there anything else you want to tell me?No.Report to the new Quartermaster for your documentation.He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner willput you two together. Good luck.Thank you.007.You are ready for this?Yes, ma'am.I didn't know Bond passed the tests.He didn't.Always makes me feel a little melancholy.A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.The inevitability of time, don't you think?What do you see?A bloody big ship.Excuse me.007...I'm your new Quartermaster.You must be joking.Why, because I'm not wearing a lab coat?Because you still have spots.My complexion is hardly relevant.Well, your competence is.Age is no guarantee of efficiency.And youth is no guarantee of innovation.I'll hazard I can do more damageon my laptop sitting in my pajamasbefore my first cup of Earl Greythan you can do in a year in the field.Oh, so why do you need me?Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.Or not pulled.It's hard to know which in your pajamas.Q.007.Ticket to Shanghai.Documentation and passport.Thank you.And this.Walther PPK/S 9mm short.There's a micro-dermal sensor in the grip.It's been coded to your palm print so only you can fire it.Less of a random killing machine, more of a personal statement.And this?Standard issue radio transmitter.Activate it and it broadcasts your location.Distress signal.And that's it.A gun...and a radio.Not exactly Christmas, is it?Were you expecting an exploding pen?We don't really go in for that anymore.Good luck out there in the field.And please return the equipment in one piece.Brave new world.Who's got the list?Tell me! Who are you working for?Tanner... he's posted the first five names.Their cover's blown. They're in danger. Get them out now.Room service.I didn't order anything. Not even you.I've got some new information.Aren't you a little overqualified to be delivering messages?It's all part of the learning curve.And Q's afraid of flying.Of course he is.So whoever stole the list has already decrypted it.They posted the first five names on the web.Well, it was only a matter of time.Well, that's just the start.They're posting five more next week, and the week after.It's some kind of sadistic game.Cut-throat razor.How very traditional.Well, I like to do some things the old-fashioned way.Sometimes the old ways are the best.Are you putting your life in my hands again?M's...already briefed me on the list.Raising the tantalizing questionof what you're really doing here.My official directive was to help...""in any way I can.""Like spying for Mallory.You know, Mallory's not as bad as you think.He's a bureaucrat.You should do your homework.Gareth Mallory was a Lieutenant Colonel...Lieutenant Colonel in Northern Ireland, Hereford Regiment.Spent three months at the hands of the IRA.So there's more to him than meets the eye.We'll see.Keep still.This is the tricky part.Now that's better.You look the part now.- Mm-hmm?- Mmm.And what part's that?Old dog,new tricks.Good evening.Evening.Don't touch your ear.I've got three exits,lots of blind spots.I've got them covered.You look beautiful in that dress.You don't scrub up so bad yourself.It's amazing what one can do with an extra pair of hands.You're telling me.Do you gamble?I like a little flutter now and then.Who doesn't like to take chances?Good evening, sir. How may I help you?I'd like to cash this in, please.One moment, sir.Good fortune tonight, sir.Let's hope so.With compliments of the house.Thank you.Now you can afford to buy me a drink.Maybe I'll even stretch to two.I'm guessing I've got four million euros in here.Not bad. I like this game.Why don't we play another?I don't gamble.I'm not very lucky.A little like our friend in Shanghai.I've been waiting to see who would redeem the chip.You made such a bold entrance into our little drama.Did I over-complicate the plot?Who doesn't appreciate the occasional twist, Mr...?Bond.James Bond.Severine.So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your next performance over that drink?I'd like that.Will your friends be joining us?That, I'm afraid, is inevitable.She's pretty.Now, now.If you like that sort of thing.I'll keep you posted.Perfect.Would you mind if I asked you a business question?Depends on the question.It has to do with death.A subject in which you're well-versed.And how would you know that?Only a certain kind of woman wears a backless dresswith a Beretta 70 strapped to her thigh.One can never be too careful whenhandsome men in tuxedos carry Walthers.I am correct in assuming you killed Patrice?Yes.Might I ask why?I want to meet your employer.Be careful what you wish for.You're scared.Thank you for the drink,Mr. Bond.You put on a good show.But ever since we sat down, you haven't stoppedlooking at your bodyguards.Three of them is a bit excessive.They're controlling you. They're not protecting you.The tattoo on your wrist is Macau sex trade.You belonged to one of the houses. What were you? 12? 13?I'm guessing he was your way out.Perhaps you thought you were in love.But that was a long time ago.You know nothing about it.I know when a woman is afraid and pretending not to be.How much do you know about fear?All there is.Not like this.Not like him.I can help you.I don't think so.Let me try.How?Bring me to him.Can you kill him?Yes.Will you?Someone usually dies.Perhaps you can.When I leave, they're going to kill you.If you survive, I'm on the Chimera. North harbor.Berth seven.We cast off in an hour.Very nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.Good luck.Good luck with that.Thank you.Put it all on red.It's the circle of life.Yes!It's time to cast off.All right.I like you better without your Beretta.I feel naked without it.Good evening.The controversy surrounding the Ministry of Defence has escalated todayas images of the Husein assassination continue to circulate.We should warn you, some viewersmight find these images disturbing.Captain Husein, an MI6 operative embedded in the Middle East,was one of the five agents exposedin what is now being consideredthe greatest internal security breach in modern British history.The Prime Minister continues to express public support for MI6while the opposition has taken the position...Has taken the position we're a bunch of antiquated bloody idiotsfighting a war we don't understand and can't possibly win.Look, three of my agents are dead already.Don't embroil me in politics now.The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry. You'll have to appear.Oh, standing in the stocks at midday? Who's antiquated now?For Christ's sake, listen to yourself. We're a democracy,accountable to the people we're trying to defend.We can't keep working in the shadows. There are no more shadows.You don't get this, do you?Whoever's behind this, whoever's doing it, he knows us.He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond.The place you say doesn't exist.The shadows.It's not too late. We could turn back now.I wouldn't be so sure.They abandoned it almost overnight.He made them think there was a leak at the chemical plant.It's amazing the panic you can cause with a single computer.He wanted the island, so he took it.Does he always get what he wants?More than you know.I'm sorry.Hello, James. Welcome.Do you like the island?My grandmother had an island.Nothing to boast of. You could walk around it in an hour.But still, it was, it was a paradise for us.One summer, we went for a visitand discovered the place had been infested with rats!They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut.So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm?My grandmother showed me.We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid,then wired coconut to the lid as bait.And the rats would come for the coconut and...they would fall into the drum.And after a month, you have trapped all the rats.But what do you do then?Throw the drum into the ocean?Burn it? No.You just leave it.And they begin to get hungry.And one by one...they start eating each otheruntil there are only two left. The two survivors.And then what? Do you kill them? No.You take them and release them into the trees.But now they don't eat coconut anymore.Now they only eat rat.You have changed their nature.The two survivors,this is what she made us.I made my own choices.You think you did.That's her genius.Station H. Am I right? Hong Kong.Mm-hmm.'86 to '97.Back then, I was her favorite.And you're not nearly the agent I was, I can tell you that.Just look at you, barely held together by your pills and your drink.Don't forget my pathetic love of country.You're still clinging to your faith in that old woman.- When all she does is lie to you.- She never lied to me.- No?- No.What did you score in your marksmanship evaluation?70.40.Did she tell you the psychologist cleared you for duty?- Yes.- No. No.Medical evaluation, fail. Physical evaluation, failed.Psychological evaluation, ""Alcoholand substance addiction indicated.""""Pathological rejection of authoritybased on unresolved childhood trauma.""""Subject is not approved for field dutyand immediate suspension from service advised.""What is this if not betrayal?She sent you after me knowing you're not ready, knowing you'll likely die.Mommy was very bad!Hmm?Ooh.See what she's done to you?Well, she never tied me to a chair.Her loss.Are you sure this is about M?It's about her.And you, and me.You see, we are the last two rats.We can either eat each other...hmm?Or eat everyone else.How you're trying to remember your training now.What's the regulation to cover this?Well, first time for everything. Yes?What makes you think this is my first time?Oh, Mr. Bond!All that physical stuff... so dull, so dull.Chasing spies...so old-fashioned!Your knees must be killing you.England.The Empire! MI6!You're living in a ruin as well,you just don't know it yet.At least here there are no old ladies giving orders and no little...bip!Gadgets from those fools in Q-Branch.If you wanted, you could pick your own secret missions. As I do.Name it. Name it.Destabilize a multinational by manipulating stocks...Bip. Easy.Interrupt transmissions from a spy satellite over Kabul...Done.Rig an election in Uganda. All to the highest bidder.Or a gas explosion in London.Just point and click.Well, everybody needs a hobby.So what's yours?Resurrection.Let me show you something.Tells a story, doesn't it?They left the island so quickly,they couldn't decide what to take,what to leave, what was important.And seeing this every day reminds me to focus on the essentials.There's nothing... nothing superfluous in my life.When a thing is redundant, it is eliminated.50-year-old Macallan.A particular favorite of yours, I understand.So, what's the toast?""To the women we love""?Darling.Darling, your lovers are here.No, no, no, no.Stand up straight. Keep still.And whatever you do, don't lose your head.Don't lose...your head.Don't lose your head.Time to redeem your marksmanship scores.Let's see.Who can be the first to knock the glass from her head?And just to be sporting, I'll let you go first.Let's see who ends up on top.Oh, I can't believe it.I can't believe it! Did you really die that day?Is there any, any of the old 007 left?My turn.I win. What do you say to that?It's a waste of good Scotch.What are you going to do now? Take me back to her? All on your own?Who says I'm on my own?It's the latest thing from Q-Branch.It's called a radio.All right, time to say hello.You're smaller than I remember!Whereas I barely remember you at all.Strange. For me, it feels just like yesterday.Are you surprised?Not particularly. But then you always were a slippery one.Maybe that's why you liked me so much.You flatter yourself.No remorse.Just as I had imagined.Regret is unprofessional.""Regret is unprofessional.""They kept me for five months in a room with no air. They tortured me.And I protected your secrets. I protected you.But they made me suffer. And suffer.And suffer.Until I realized...it was you who betrayed me.You betrayed me.So, I had only one thing left.My cyanide capsule in my back left molar.You remember, right?So I broke the tooth and...bit into the capsule.And it...it burned all my insides.But I didn't die.Life clung to me like a disease.And then...I understood why I had survived.I needed to look in your eyes one last time.Well, I hope it was worth it.Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred to Belmarsh Prisonwhere you'll be remanded in custodyuntil the Crown Prosecution Servicedeem you fit to stand trial for...Say my name. Say it.My real name.I know you remember it.Your name is on the memorial wallof the very building you attacked.I will have it struck off.Soon your past will be as nonexistent as your future.I'll never see you again.Do you know what it does to you?Hydrogen cyanide?Look upon your work.Mother.Let me know what you recover from his computer.Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom? I want this resolved.Yes, ma'am.His name is Tiago Rodriguez.He was a brilliant agent.But he started operating beyond his brief, hacking the Chinese.The handover was coming up and they were onto him, so I gave him up.I got six agents in return and a peaceful transition.We should go, ma'am. Board of Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.I want to know what's on that computer.Now, looking at Silva's computer,it seems to me he's done a number of slightly unusual things.He's established failsafe protocols to wipe the memoryif there's any attempt to access certain files.Only six people in the world could program safeguards like that.Of course there are. Can you get past them?I invented them.Right, then.Let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Silva.We're in.Sir, what do you make of this?It's his Omega site.Most encrypted level he has.Looks like obfuscated code to conceal its true purpose.Security through obscurity.Ladies and gentlemen, if I might have order?I'd like to begin the proceedings.We're gathered today to address important issuesconcerning the future of our national security.Going somewhere?So you believe your stewardship of Ml6 during the recent crisishas been up to scratch?Well, I believe we have apprehended the responsible partyand are taking all necessary stepsto ensure that the sensitive information is contained.So it's a job well done.I'm not saying it's gone perfectly, but...You'll forgive me for not putting up the bunting.I find it rather difficult to overlook monumentalsecurity breaches and dead operativesfor which you are almost single-handedly responsible.He's using a polymorphic engine to mutate the code.whenever I try to gain access, it changes.It's like solving a Rubik's cube that's fighting back.Stop.Go in on that.Granborough.Granborough Road. It's an old Tube station on the Metropolitan Line.Been closed for years.Use that as a key.Oh, look, it's a map!It's London.Subterranean London.What's going on? Why are the doors open?Oh, no.Can someone tell me how the hell he got into our system?Oh, shit.Oh, shit, shit, shit.He hacked us.Oh, no.Q.He's gone.I'm in a stairwell below isolation.Do you read me, Q?I can hear you. I'm looking for you.Got you. Tracking your location.Just keep moving forward.Enter the next service door on your right.If you're through that door, you should be in the Tube.I'm in the Tube.Bond, this isn't an escape. This was years in the planning.He wanted us to capture him, he wanted us to access his computer.It was all planned.Blowing up HQ. Knowing the emergency protocols.Knowing we'd retreat down here.I've got all that. It's what he's got planned next that worries me.District Line is the closest. There's a service door on your left.Got it.It won't open.It will. Put your back into it.Why don't you come down here and put your back into it?No, it's stuck.Oh, good. There's a train coming.Hmm. That's vexing.I'm through.Told you.We alerted security. Police are on their way.Where are you now?Temple Tube station.Along with half of London.Oh, I see you. There you are.I know where I am, Q. Where's he?Give us a second. I'm looking for him.Mind the gap.There's too many people. I can't see him.Welcome to rush hour on the Tube.Not something you'd know much about.Mind the gap.The train's leaving. Do I get on the train?Don't get on. I'm not sure he's on it. Give us a minute.Do I get on the train?Bond.- What?- Get on the train.He's keen to get home.Will you open the door, please?Open the door.Health and Safety. Carry on.Where are you?Take a wild guess, Q.He's in disguise, dressed as a policeman.Of course he is.Where's he going? Where's he going?He's going for M. Tell Tanner. Get her out of there.You've overlooked, or chosen to ignore, hard evidenceand consistently, almost obstinately...Silva's escaped. Bond's in pursuit.We need to get you to a secure location immediately.I'll be damned if I'm gonna show her my back.Are we straining your attention?No. Please, Minister, proceed.Excuse me.Move! Move!It's as if you insist on pretendingwe still live in a golden age of espionagewhere human intelligence was the only resource available.Well, I find this rather old-fashioned beliefdemonstrates a reckless disregard for...Excuse me, Minister, I don't mean to interrupt,but just for the sake of variety,might we actually hear from the witness?Of course.Thank you.I won't miss next time, Mr. Silva.Not bad. Not bad, James, for a physical wreck.Thank you.You caught me.Now, here's your prize.The latest thing from my local toy store.It's called radio.Whew!I do hope that wasn't for me.No.But that is.Chairman. Ministers.Today I've repeatedly heard howirrelevant my department has become.Why do we need agents? The Double-O section?Isn't it all rather quaint?Well, I suppose I see a different world than you do.And the truth is that what I see frightens me.I'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us.They do not exist on a map.They're not nations. They are individuals.Look around you. Who do you fear?Can you see a face? A uniform? A flag? No.Our world is not more transparent now.It's more opaque.It's in the shadows.That's where we must do battle.So, before you declare us irrelevant, ask yourselves,How safe do you feel?I've just one more thing to say.My late husband was a great lover of poetry.And, um...I suppose some of it sunk in, despite my best intentions.And here today I remember this, I think from Tennyson.We are not now that strength,which in old days moved earth and heaven.That which we are, we are.One equal temper of heroic hearts,made weak by timeand fate,but strong in will.To strive, to seek,to findand not to yield.Go, go, go, go!Move!Move! Go! Move!007, what the hell are we doing? Are you kidnapping me?That would be one way of looking at it.Too many people are dying because of me.If he wants you, he'll have to come and get you.We've been one step behind Silva from the start.It's time to get out in front, change the game.And I'm to be the bait?All right. But just us. No one else.Q? I need help.I'm tracking the car. Where are you going?I've got M. We're about to disappear.What?I need you to lay a trail of breadcrumbs impossible to followfor anyone except Silva. Think you can do it?I'm guessing this isn't strictly official.Not even remotely.So much for my promising career in espionage.I'm not hiding in there, if that's your brilliant plan.We're changing vehicles.Trouble with company cars is they have trackers.Oh, and I suppose that's completely inconspicuous.Get in.It's not very comfortable, is it?Are you gonna complain the whole way?Oh, go on then, eject me. See if I care.Where are we going?Back in time.Somewhere we'll have the advantage.It's a fine line.Make the breadcrumb too small and he might miss it.Too big and Silva will smell a rat.But do you think even Silva will be able to spot that?He's the only one who could.Sir.Oh.What are you doing?We're just... monitoring.Creating a false tracking signal for Silva to follow.- Well, sir, um...- Well, no.Excellent thinking. Get him isolated.Send him on the A9. It's the direct route.You can monitor his progress more accuratelyand confirm it with the traffic cameras.But what if the PM finds out?Then we're all buggered.Carry on.Is this where you grew up?Mm.How old were you when they died?You know the answer to that.You know the whole story.Orphans always make the best recruits.Storm's coming.Christ.Mm-hmm.No wonder you never came back.James.James Bond.Good God.Are you still alive?It's nice to see you, too.M, this is Kincade.Gamekeeper here since I was a boy.Pleased to meet you, Emma.Mr. Kincade.You're a tad late. They've sold the place,when they thought you were dead.It seems they were wrong.What are you doing here?Some men are coming to kill us.But we're gonna kill them first.Then we'd better get ready.Do we still have a gun room?Ah.They sold the lot to a collector from Idaho or some such place.They were shipped out weeks ago.There's just...your father's old hunting rifle.We couldn't let that go.And this is what we've got.There might be a couple of sticks of dynamite from the quarry.But if all else fails,sometimes the old ways are the best.So who is it we're supposed to be fighting?No ""we"" in it, Kincade.This is not your fight.Try and stop me, you jumped-up little shit.Now, remember what I taught you. Don't let it pull to the left.I'll do my best.What did you say you did for a living?Emma!I brought you some things.The nights get cold here.Thank you, Mr. Kincade.It's a beautiful old house.She is.And like all great ladies, she still has her secret ways.Let me show you this.Priest's hole?Yeah, from Reformation times.The tunnel leads under the moor.If you get in danger, this is the place to come.The night I told him his parents had died, he hid in here for two days.When he did come out...he wasn't a boy anymore.Eh. Must get on.I fucked this up, didn't I?No.You did your job.I read your obituary of me.And?Appalling.Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.I did call you ""an exemplar of British fortitude"".That bit was all right.You ready?I was ready before you were born, son.Welcome to Scotland.You dropped something.You hurt?Only my pride. I never was a good shot.He's not here.Always got to make an entrance.You two, go to the kitchen. Now.Get behind the arch!Go to the chapel. Use the tunnel.Everyone, listen to me! Don't you dare touch her. She's mine.Can your friend come out and say hello?Come on. This way.I always hated this place.Are you getting warm?Just make sure Bond's dead!Now it's me and her.You see what comes of all this running around, Mr. Bond?All this jumping and fighting.It's exhausting!Relax.You need to relax.Ah, well... mother's calling.I'll give her a goodbye kiss for you.Oh, my God.Of course.It had to be here.It had to be this way.Thank you.- I can't find it no...- Don't.Please. Don't.You're hurt. You're hurt.What have they done to you?Free both of us.Free both of us...with the same bullet.Do it.Only you can do it.Do it.Ah!Last rat standing.007. What took you so long?Well, I got into some deep water.Oh!I suppose it's...too late to make a run for it?Well, I'm game if you are.I did get one thing right.Wow.I didn't even know you could come up here.Hate to waste a view.I can see why.I thought you were going back out on active service.I declined.You said it yourself,fieldwork's not for everyone.If it helps, I feel a lot safer.Her will was read today.She left you this.Maybe it was her way of telling you to take a desk job.Just the opposite.Thank you.You know, we've never formally been introduced.Well, my name's Eve.Eve Moneypenny.Well, I look forward to our time together, Miss Moneypenny.Me, too. I'm sure we'll have one or two close shaves.Morning, 007.Good morning, Tanner.He'll see you now.How's the arm, sir?What? Oh, it's fine.It'll get better.All pretty shocking for someone unused to fieldwork.So, 007... lots to be done.Are you ready to get back to work?With pleasure, M.With pleasure.","polarity -0.004,subjectivity 0.586"
9,Some Like It Hot,"Two musicians witness a mob hit and struggle to find a way out of the city before they are found by the gangsters.

No rough talk.They went to a conservatory.How about that talent, huh?- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.- Watch it, Daphne.When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I waslocked up overnight in a pastry shop.And there was goodies all around.Jelly rolls, mocha ?clairsand Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...Listen to me: No butter, no pastry.We're on a diet.Yeah, sure, Joe.Not there. That's the emergency brake.Now you've done it.- Done what?- You tore off one of my chests.- You'd better go get it fixed.- You'd better come help me.This way, Daphne.Now you tore the other one.Terribly sorry.It's OK. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.- You won't tell anybody, will you?- Tell what?If they catch me once more,they'll kick me out of the band.Are you the replacementfor the bass and sax?That's us. And I'm Daphne.This is Joe... sephine.Come in.I'm Sugar Cane.- Sugar Cane?- I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.- Polish?- Yes. I come from this musical family.My mother's a piano teacher.My father was a conductor.- Where did he conduct?- On the Baltimore and Ohio.I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.I don't have much of a voice,but this isn't much of a band, either.I'm only with them cos I'm running away.- Running away from what?- Oh, don't get me started on that.Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.I'll take a rain check.I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.I can stop if I want to, only I don't want to.- Especially when I'm blue.- We understand.All the girls drink. But I'm the onethat gets caught. Story of my life.I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.Are my seams straight?I'll say.- See you around, girls.- Bye, Sugar.We have been playingwith the wrong bands.- Down, Daphne.- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?Forget it. One false moveand we're off the train.Then it's the police,the papers and the Mob in Chicago.Boy, would I love toborrow a cup of that Sugar.Look...No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.You tore 'em again.Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?Playing square dances?No. Funerals.Would you mind rejoining the living?Goose it up a little.We'll try.How did those holes get there?Those?I don't know.Mice?All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.And put a little heat under it.Bienstock!Yes, Sue?I thought I made it clearthat I don't want any drinking in this outfit.All right, girls. Who does this belong to?Come on, now. Speak up.- Sugar, I warned you...- Please, Mr Bienstock.I've had it. In Kansas you smuggledliquor in a shampoo bottle.Before that you hada pint in your ukelele...Mr Bienstock, could I have my flask?Sure. Pack your things.At the next station... Your flask?Yes. Just a little bourbon.Must have slipped through.Give me that.Didn't you girls sayyou went to a conservatory?- Oh, yes. For a whole year.- I thought you said three years.We got time off for good behavior.There are two things I will not put up withduring working hours: Liquor and men.- Men?- Don't worry about that.We wouldn't be caught dead with men.Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.And they all just wantone thing from a girl.I beg your pardon, miss.All right, girls. From the top again.- Hortense, dear, good night.- Good night, Daphne.- Maude, sweet dreams.- Good night, Daphne.Good night, Gloria.Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?- Nighty-night, Emily.- Toodle-oo.How about that ""toodle-oo.""Steady, boy.Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.- I'm a girl.- You're a girl.I'm a girl. I'm a girl.I'm a...Get a load of that rhythm section.I'm a girl.I'm a girl. I'm a girl.I'm a girl.Good night, Sugar.Good night, honey.Honey? Hey, she called me ""honey.""Ooh, honey.- What are you doin'?- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.Supposin' I gotta go...like for a drink of water or something.- Fight it.- Well, suppose I lose.- Suppose it's an emergency.- Pull the emergency brake.Hey, Bienstock. You know, there'ssomething funny about those new girls.- Funny? In what way?- I don't know, but I can feel it right here.Having an ulcer is likehaving a burglar alarm go off inside you.You watch your ulcers,I'll watch those two.OK, everybody go to bed.Good night, girls.- Good night, Daphne.- Good night, Josephine.I'm a girl. I'm a girl.I wish I were dead.I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...Daphne.Sugar.I wanted to thank you forcovering up for me. You're a real pal.It's nothing.I just thought thatus girls should stick together.If it wasn't for you,they'd have kicked me off the train.I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,sitting on my ukulele.It's freezing outside.I mean, when I think about youand your poor ukulele...If there's ever anything I can do for you...I can think of a million things.That's one of 'em.It's Sweet Sue.I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.Not even Josephine.Maybe I'd better stay heretill she goes back to sleep.You stay here as long as you like.I'm not crowding you, am I?No. It's nice and cosy.When I was a little girl, on cold nightslike this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.We'd cuddle up under the covers andpretend we were lost in a dark caveand were trying to find our way out.Very interesting.- Anything wrong?- No, no. Not a thing.You poor thing. You're trembling all over.That's ridiculous.- Your head's hot.- That's ridiculous.- You've got cold feet.- Isn't that ridiculous?Here, let me warm them up a little.- There. Isn't that better?- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...- What?- I'm a very sick girl.- I'd better go before I catch something.- Not that sick.I've got very low resistance.Sugar, if you feel you'recoming down with something, my dear,the best thing in the worldis a shot of whiskey.- You've got some?- I know where to get it.Don't move.- Hold on.- OK.Up. Up.- Are you all right?- I'm fine.- How's the bottle?- Half-full.- You'd better get some cups.- Cups?Oh, I tell you, my dear,this is the only way to travel.Put on the lights.I can't see what I'm doing.No lights. We don't want them to know.- But I might spill some.- So spill it.Spills, thrills, laughs and games.This may even turn outto be a surprise party.- What's the surprise?- Not yet.- When?- Better have a drink first.That'll put hair on your chest.No fair guessing.Is this a private clambake?It's private. Please, go away.Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?- Sure.- Who needs vermouth?We've got bourbon.We can make Manhattans.Manhattans? At this time of night?- Bring the cocktail shaker.- Oh, Sugar.You're gonna spoil my surprise.- Hey, honey, what's up?- Party in upper 7.- I'll get cheese and crackers.- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.- You got a corkscrew?- Stella has.Go get some paper cups.Hey, there's a party in upper 7.- Here's the vermouth.- This is a private party. Please go away.I brought some cheese and crackers.- Will ten cups be enough?- This is a party for two. Ten cups?- Please, girls. Will you stop this?- Could you use some Southern Comfort?Girls, you'll wake upthe neighbors downstairs.Watch that corkscrew.- Here's a cracker.- No crackers in bed.Will you girls go awayand form your own party?Here's the cocktail shaker.- I wish we had ice.- Easy on the vermouth.13 girls in a berth is bad luck.12 of you will have to get out.- Pass me the peanut butter.- Anyone for salami?No more food.I'll have ants in the morning.Hey. Have you got anymaraschino cherries on you?Never mind.Maraschino cherries?What's going on here?Daphne. Daphne, where are you?It's not my fault. I didn't invite 'em.Come on, girls, break it up.You heard Josephine.Girls. Everybody out.- Not you, Sugar.- I'm going to get some ice.Get out.That's right, Sugar.Now the rest of you. Out.- Come on in. The water's fine.- Have a Manhattan.- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.You've had your fun.The party's over. Everybody go home.- What's this?- Josephine, over here before it melts.Put it here.Sugar, you're gonnaget into a lot of trouble.You'd better keep a lookout.If Bienstock catches you again...What's the matter with you, anyway?I'm not very bright, I guess.I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.No, just dumb. If I had any brains, Iwouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.Well, why'd you take this job?I used to sing with male bands,but I can't afford it anymore.Have you ever been with a male band?Who, me?That's what I'm running away from.I worked with six in the last two years.Oh, brother.- Rough?- I'll say.- You can't trust those guys.- I can't trust myself.I have this thingabout saxophone players.Especially tenor sax.- Really?- I don't know why, but they curdle me.All they have to do is play eight bars of""Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby""and I get goose-pimply all over,and I come to 'em.- That so?- Every time.You know, I play tenor sax.But you're a girl - thank goodness.That's why I joined this band.Safety first. Anythingto get away from those bums.You don't know what they're like.You fall for 'em.You think this is gonna bethe biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.The next thing you know,they're borrowing money from you,spending it on other damesand betting on horses.You don't say.Then one morning you wake up,the guy's gone, the sax's gone.All that's left is a pair of old socksand a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.You pull yourself together, you go on tothe next job, the next saxophone player.It's the same thing all over again.You see what I mean? Not very bright.Brains aren't everything.I can tell you one thing. It's notgonna happen to me again - ever.I'm tired of gettingthe fuzzy end of the lollipop.Ice. What's keeping the ice?The natives are getting restless.- How about a couple of drinks for us?- Sure.- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.- You are?That's a quarter of a century.Makes a girl think.- About what?- The future.You know - like a husband. That's whyI'm glad we're going to Florida.- What's in Florida?- Millionaires. Flocks of them.They all go south for the winter,like birds.- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?- I don't care how rich he is.As long as he has a yacht, a privaterailroad car and his own toothpaste.- You're entitled.- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.With money like Rockefeller andshoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.- I want mine to wear glasses.- Glasses?Men who wear glasses are so muchmore gentle and sweet and helpless.- Haven't you ever noticed it?- Yeah, now that you mention.They get those weak eyes from reading.Those long, tiny little columnsin The Wall Street Journal.That bass fiddle, she sureknows how to throw a party.Hot-diggety-dog.Well, happy days.I hope this time you wind upwith the sweet end of the lollipop.So the one-legged jockey said...What did he say?So the one-legged jockey said: ""Don'tworry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle.""I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.I think... Ow. You dropped it.Oh, that's cold.- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.- She's ticklish.Help. Please. Help. Help.Josephine.Please stop that. Stop that.- What happened?- Search me.I mean, I'll see.All right, what's goin' on around here?Bienstock!Are we in Florida?Sugar?Here. I'll carry the instruments.- Thank you, Daphne.- Thank you, Daphne.Isn't she a sweetheart?How do you do?Zowie!There they are. More millionairesthan you can shake a stick at.I bet there isn't one under 75.That's three quarters of a century.Makes a girl think.Let's hope they broughttheir grandsons along.Yes.Pardon me, miss.- May I?- Help yourself.I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.I'm Cinderella the Second.If there's one thing I admire,it's a girl with a shapely ankle.Me, too. Bye-bye.- Let me carry one of the instruments.- Oh, thank you.Aren't you a sweetheart.It certainly is delightfulhaving young blood around here.Personally, I'm type O.I've always been fascinatedby show business.Is that so?As a matter of fact,it's cost my family quite a bit of money.- Oh, you invest in shows?- Showgirls.- I've been married seven or eight times.- You're not sure?Mama is keeping score.- She's getting annoyed with me.- I wouldn't wonder.So when George White's Scandalsopened, she packed me off to Florida.She thinks I'm out on my yacht,deep-sea fishing.Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.You're barking up the wrong fish.If I promise not to be a naughty boy,how about dinner?- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.- Oh, of course.- Which instrument do you play?- Bull fiddle.Oh, fascinating.Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?Most of the time, I slap it.You must be quite a girl.Wanna bet?My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.Sort of a contortionist.She could smoke a cigarettewhile holding it between her toes.Zowie!- But Mama broke it up.- Why?She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.- Bye-bye?- This is where I get off.- Oh, no. No, no, no.You don't get off that easy.All right, driver.Once around the park, slowly.And keep your eyes on the road.What kind of a girldo you think I am, Mr Fielding?- Oh, please. It won't happen again.- I'll say.- Please, come back.- I'll walk, thank you.Please, miss...Zowie!All right, girls. Here areyour room assignments.My glasses. Where are my glasses?Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.And, Mary Lou, do up your kimonowhen you ring for room service.Josephine and Daphne are in 413.- Dolores and Sugar in 414.- Me and Sugar?What did you expect?A one-legged jockey?Rosella and Emily in 415...- I wish they'd put us in the same room.- So do I.But don't worry about it, Sugar.We'll see a lot of each other.414... That's the same room numberI had in Cincinnati,my last time around with a male band.What a heel he was.- A saxophone player?- What else? Was I ever crazy about him.At two in the morning he sent me downfor hot dogs and potato salad.They were out of potato salad,so I brought coleslaw.- So he threw it right in my face.- Forget saxophone players.You're gonna meeta millionaire - a young one.- What makes you so sure?- My feminine intuition.Oh. Are these your bags?- And that one, too.- OK, doll.- I suppose you want a tip.- Forget it, doll.After all, you work here and I work here.It's nice to have you with the organization.- Bye-bye.- Listen, doll.- What time do you get off tonight?- Why?I'm workin' the night shift andI got a bottle of gin stashed away.- When there's a lull...- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?Oh, you wanna see my driver's license?- Get lost, will you?- That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.- Dirty old man.- What happened?- I got pinched in the elevator.- See how the other half lives?I'm not even pretty.They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.It's like waving a red flag to a bull.I'm sick of being the flag.I wanna be a bull again.- Let's blow.- Blow where?You promised me that the minutewe hit Florida we'd beat it.- How can we? We're broke.- We can find another band. A male band.Spats Colombo is looking for usin every male band in the country.- It's humiliating.- So you got pinched. So what?Would you rather bepicking lead out of your navel?But how long can we keep this up?What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.Look. We get room and board.We're getting paid every week. Look.Look at the palm trees, flying fish...What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?I know why you wanna stay.You're after Sugar.- Me, after Sugar?- I saw the both of you in that bus.All lovey-dovey and whisperin'and borrowin' each other's lipstick.- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?- You and Sugar.- We're just like sisters.- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.Are you decent?Come in.You girls seen a brown bagwith a white stripe and my initials?It has all my resort clothes.- No, we haven't.- I can't understand it.First my glasses disappear,then one of my suitcases.- Where's my ukulele?- Now a ukulele.- There must be a sneak thief round here.- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.- We're going for a swim. Coming?- A swim. Oh, you betcha.You haven't got a bathing suit.I don't have one either.- She doesn't have one either. You don't?- We can rent some at the bathhouse.- How about you, Josephine?- I think I'll soak in a hot tub.- On a day like this? It's lovely out.- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.- Don't get burned, Daphne.- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.Daphne. Cut it out.What do you think you're doing?Just a little trickI picked up in the elevator.Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.Daphne. I had no ideayou were such a big girl.You should've seen mebefore I went on a diet.I mean your shoulders and your arms.It's carrying that bull fiddle around.- There's one thing I envy you for.- What's that?You're so flat-chested.Clothes hang better on youthan they do on me.Watch out, Daphne.Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.Junior, time for your nap.No. I wanna play.You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!This beach ain't big enoughfor the both of us.Mommy!Here we go.I like coffee, I like tea.How many boys are stuck on me?One, two, three,four, five, six, seven...I'm terribly sorry.You're not hurt, are you?- I don't think so.- I wish you'd make sure.Because when people find out who I am,they hire a shyster lawyer and sue mefor three quarters of a million dollars.- I won't sue you, no matter who you are.- Thank you.- Who are you?- Now, really!Sugar!Come on.Honestly.Cheerio.- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?- Not very likely.- Are you staying at the hotel?- Not at all.Your face is familiar.You may have seen itin newspapers or magazines.- Vanity Fair.- That must be it.Would you mind moving a little?You're blocking my view.Of what?They run up a red-and-white flagon the yacht when it's time for cocktails.You own a yacht?Which one is it? The big one?Certainly not.With all the world unrest, nobody shouldhave a yacht that sleeps more than 12.I quite agree.Tell me, who runs up that flag?- Your wife?- No, my flag steward.Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?No, my cocktail steward.If you're interested inwhether I am married or not...- Oh, I'm not interested at all.- Well, I'm not.That's very interesting.- How's the stock market?- Up, up, up.I'll bet while we were talking,you made $100,000?Could be. You play the market?- No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.- For your own amusement?We are appearing at the hotel.Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.- You're society girls.- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...We're just doing this for a lark.Syncopators. Does that mean you playthat very fast music... jazz?Yeah. Real hot.I guess some like it hot.I personally prefer classical music.I do, too.As a matter of fact, I spent three yearsat the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.Good school. Your familydoesn't object to your career?They do indeed. Daddy threatenedto cut me off without a cent.But I don't care. It was such a bore.- Coming-out parties.- Inauguration balls.- Opening at the opera.- Riding to hounds.And always the same 400.It's amazing we neverran into each other before.I'd have rememberedanybody as attractive as you.You're very kind. I'll betyou're also gentle and helpless.I beg your pardon?You see, I have a theoryabout men who wear glasses.- What theory?- I'll tell you when I know you better.- What are you doing tonight?- Tonight?Maybe you could cometo the hotel and hear us play.- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.- Why?I only come ashore twice a daywhen the tide goes out.It's on account of these shells.That's my hobby.- You collect shells?- So did my father and grandfather.You might say we hada passion for shells.That's why we namedthe oil company after it.- Shell Oil?- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.Sugar!Time to change for dinner.Run along, Daphne dear.I'll catch up with you later.What, young lady?What are you staring at?Happens to me all the time.I recognized him, too.His picture was in Vanity Fair.- Would you move along, please?- Yes. You're in his way.He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.His yacht?It sleeps 12. This is my friend Daphne.She's a Vassar girl.I'm a what?Or was it Bryn Mawr?I heard a very sad storyabout a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.She squealed on her roommateand they found her strangledwith her own brassiere.Yes. We have to be very carefulwhom we pick for a roommate. Hm?Well, I think I'd better be going.It was delightful meeting you both.- You will come and hear us play?- If it's at all possible.Do come. It'll be such fun.- And bring your yacht.- Come on, Daphne.- How about that guy?!- Hands off. I saw him first.Sugar, a little advice. If I were a girl,and I am, I'd watch my step.If I'd been watching my step,I never would have met him.- I can't wait to tell Josephine.- Yeah, Josephine...I can't wait to see her face.Will she be surprised.Neither can I.Let's go tell her right now.- We don't have to run.- Oh yes, we do.Josephine. Yoo-hoo.- I guess she's not here.- Isn't that funny. Josie!I can't imagine where she'd be.- I'll be back later.- Oh, no. You wait.I have a feelingshe'll show up any minute.- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.- Yes. This is one for Ripley.- Do you suppose she went shopping?- Shopping. That's it.Something tells me she's gonna comethrough that door in a brand-new outfit.- Josephine.- Oh. I didn't hear you come in.- Have a good time, girls?- The most wonderful thing happened.- What?- Guess.- They repealed Prohibition?- Oh, you can do better than that.- I met one of them.- One of whom?Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,glasses and a yacht.You don't say.He's not only got a yacht.He's got a bicycle.Daphne.Go on. Tell me all about him.Well, he's young and he's handsome.He's a bachelor.He's a real gentleman.You know. Not one of these grabbers.Maybe you'd better go after himif you don't want to lose him.I'm not gonna let this one get away.He's so cute. He collects shells.Shells? Whatever for?Oh, you know. The old shell game?Daphne, you're bothering us.- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.- I am?He said he'd cometo hear us play - maybe.What do you mean, maybe? I saw howhe looked at you. He'll be there for sure.I hope so.What do you think, Josephine?What does your crystal ball say?Sugar. Is Sugar in here?Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked outand I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.See you on the bandstand, girls.What are you tryin' to do to that girl,puttin' on a millionaire act?And that phony accent?Nobody talks like that.I've seen you pullsome low tricks on women.This is without doubtthe trickiest, lowest, meanest...I'm not afraid of you.I'm thin, but I'm wiry.You're gonna get hurt.When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.Joe. Don't look at me like that.It was all a joke. I didn't mean any harm.I'm gonna pressthe suit myself. Telephone.Answer the tele... phone.Hello?Yes, this is 413.Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.You know - Osgood? In the elevator?You slapped my face?- Who is this?- This is her roommate.Daphne can't talk right now. Is it urgent?Well, it is to me.Will you give her a message?Tell her I'd like her to have supper withme on my yacht after the show tonight.Got it. Supper, yacht,after the show. I'll tell her.- Your yacht?- The New Caledonia. That's its name.The Old Caledonia went downduring a wild party off Cape Hatteras.But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quietlittle midnight snack, just the two of us.Just the two of you?What about the crew?That's all been taken care of.I'm giving them shore leave.We'll have cold pheasantwith champagne.I've checked with the coastguard.There's gonna be a full moon tonight.And tell her I've gota new batch of Rudy Vallee records.That's good thinking.Daphne's a pushover for him.Pushover for who? What...Yes, Mr Fielding.You'll pick her up after the showin your motorboat. Goodbye.What's that you said?- ""Zowie."" I'll give her the message.- What message? What motorboat?You got it made. Fielding wants to havecold pheasant with you on his yacht.Just the three of you on thatgreat big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.Fat chance. Call him backand say I'm not goin'.Of course you're not.I'm going.You're gonna be on the boatwith that dirty old man?I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.- Where's he gonna be?- He's gonna be ashore with you.- With me?- That's right.Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.You can both go take a flyin' jump.Remember, he's your datefor tonight, so smile.Oh, you can do better than that.Give him the teeth, the whole personality.Why do I let you talk meinto these things? Why?Because we're pals. The two musketeers.Don't give me the musketeers.How am I gonna keep him ashore?Tell him you get seasick.Play miniature golf with him.Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caughtin a miniature sand trap with that guy.Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?Bull fiddle.From satchel mouth at table seven.- This is from me to you, doll.- Beat it, buster.Never mind leaving your door open.I got a passkey.- What are you doin' with my flowers?- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.I guess he's not gonna show up.It's five minutes to one.- Do you suppose he forgot?- You know how those millionaires are.These came for you.For me?It's Shell Oil.- No!- Yes!He wants to have supperwith me on his yacht.He's picking me up at the pier.- No!- Yes.You heard her - yes.Josephine, just imagine. Me,Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,on a millionaire's yacht.If my mother could only see me now.I hope my mother never finds out.That's it for tonight.This is Sweet Sue saying good night,reminding all you daddies out therethat every girl in my band is a virtuoso.And I intend to keep it that way.- Good luck.- Thanks.But it's such a waste.A full moon, an empty yacht.- I'll throw up.- Then let's go dancing.There's a roadhouse down the coast...Well, I'll be... He does have a bicycle.Who?About the roadhouse?They have a Cuban bandthat's the berries.Let's go there, blindfold the orchestraand tango till dawn.- You know something, Mr Fielding?- What?You're dynamite.You're a pretty hotlittle firecracker yourself.Ahoy, there.Ahoy.- Been waiting long?- It's not how long you wait.- It's who you're waiting for.- Thank you. And for the flowers.I wanted them to fly orchids from ourgreenhouse, but Long Island is fogged in.It's the thought that counts.I seem to be out of gas.It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.I mean, Shell Oil and everything.Oops. There.It seems to be stuck in reverse.I just got this motorboat.It's an experimental model.It seems like they're on the wrong track.Do you mind riding backwards?It may take a little longer.It's not how long it takes.It's who's taking you.It looked so small from the beach.But when you're on it, it's likea cruiser or a destroyer.It's just regulation-size. We have three.Mother keeps hers in Southampton.Daddy's is in Venezuela.The company is laying a new pipeline.My dad's more interested in railroads.Baltimore and Ohio.Which is the portand which is the starboard?That depends onwhether you're coming or going.I mean, normally the aftis on the other side of the stern.And that's the bridge. So that you can getfrom one side of the boat to the other.- Would you like a glass of champagne?- Love it. Which way?- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.- Yes, the hurricane cellar.And another nice thing aboutthis yacht - lots of closet space.Now, let me see. Where do yousuppose the steward set it up?In here.Of course. How silly of me.On Thursdays they alwaysserve me in the small salon.It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.It's all right for a bachelor.- What a beautiful fish.- I caught him off Cape Hatteras.What is it?It's a member of the herring family.A herring?Isn't it amazing how they get thosebig fish into those little glass jars?They shrink when they're marinated.- Champagne?- I don't mind if I do.Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.Bon voyage.- Look at all that silverware.- Trophies.You know. Skeet shooting,dog breeding, water polo.Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?I'll say. I had two poniesdrowned under me.Where's your shell collection?Yes, of course.Where could they have put it?You see, on ThursdaysI'm sort of lost around here.- What's on Thursdays?- It's the crew's night off.- You mean we're alone on the boat?- Completely.I've never been completely alonewith a man in the middle of the night,- in the middle of the ocean.- Oh, it's perfectly safe.We're anchored.The ship's in shipshape shape.The coastguard will callif any icebergs appear.It's not the icebergs.But certain men would try totake advantage of a situation like this.- You're flattering me.- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.- Harmless? How?- I don't know how to put it,but I've got this thing about girls.- What thing?- They just sort of leave me cold.You mean, like, frigid?Well, it's more like a mental block.When I'm with a girl,it does absolutely nothing to me.- Have you tried?- Have I. I'm trying all the time.See? Nothing.- Nothing at all?- Complete washout.- That makes me feel just awful.- My dear, it's not your fault.Now and then Mother Naturethrows somebody a dirty curve.Something goes wrong inside.- You mean you can't fall in love?- Not anymore.I was in love once,but I'd rather not talk about it.- Would you like a little cold pheasant?- What happened?- I don't want to bore you.- You couldn't possibly.Well...It was my freshman year at Princeton.There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.Her father wasthe vice president of Hupmobile.She wore glasses, too.That summer we wereat the Grand Canyon.We were on the highest ledgewatching the sunset,when suddenly we gotthis impulse to kiss.I took off my glasses.She took off her glasses.I took a step toward her.She took a step toward me.Yes. Eight hours laterthey brought her up by mule.I gave her three transfusions.We had the same type blood - type O.But it was too late.Talk about sad.Ever since then,numb, no feelings, like my heartwas shot full of Novocain.You poor, poor boy.Yes. All the money in the world,and what good is it?Mint sauce or cranberries?How can you think about foodat a time like this?What else is there for me?- Is it that hopeless?- My family did everything they could.Hired the most beautifulFrench upstairs maids.Got a special tutor to read mebooks that were banned in Boston.Imported a troupe of Balinese dancerswith those bells on their anklesand long fingernails.What a waste of money.Have you ever tried American girls?Why?Was that anything?Thanks just the same.You should see a doctor - a good doctor.I have. I spent six months in Viennawith Professor Freud, flat on my back.Then there were the Mayo brothers,injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.Don't say that.There must be some girlsomeplace that could...If I ever found a girl that could,I'd marry her just like that.- Would you do me a favor?- Certainly. What is it?I may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brotheror one of those French upstairs girls,but could I take another crack at it?All right, if you insist.- Anything this time?- I'm afraid not.- Terribly sorry.- Would you like some more champagne?Maybe if we had some music.How do you dim these lights?Look, it's terribly sweet of youto want to help out, but it's no use.I think the light switch is over there.That's the radio.It's like taking someoneto a concert when he's tone-deaf.You're not giving yourself a chance.Don't fight it.Relax.It's like smoking without inhaling.So inhale.Daphne,- you're leading again.- Sorry.Well?I'm not quite sure.Would you try it again?I got a funny sensation in my toes.Like someone was barbecuing themover a slow flame.Let's throw another log on the fire.I think you're on the right track.I must be.

Boy, oh boy, am I a boy.What about my engagement present?- What engagement present?- Osgood gave me a bracelet.Hey, these are real diamonds.Of course they're real.You think my fianc? is a bum?- I guess I'll have to give it back to him.- Wait a minute, Jerry.

From the yacht.Hello, my dearest darling.It's good to hear your voice.I may throw up.No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.I never slept better.I had the most wonderful dream.I was still on the yachtand the anchor broke loose.We drifted for days and days.You were the captain and I was the crew.I kept a lookout for icebergs, I sortedyour shells and mixed your cocktails,and I wiped the steam off your glasses.And when I woke up, I wantedto swim right back to you.Yes...Now, about our date for tonight...I'll meet you on the pier againright after the show.I'm afraid not.

What happened to our bracelet?- We did the right thing with it.- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.No tricks, no mirrors,nothing up my sleeve.It's on the level this time.Where's that bourbon?- What's the matter, Sugar?- I don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.How did you get that bracelet?- You like it?- I always did.Junior gave it to me. He's goneto South America to marry another girl.- That's what you call high finance.- That's what I call a louse.If I were you, I'd take that braceletand throw it back in his face.He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.The only one that ever gave me anything.You'll forget him, Sugar.How can I? No matter where I go, there'llalways be a Shell station on every corner.I'll bring this back when it's empty.Are you crazy? The placeis crawlin' with mobsters.And you're makin' likeDiamond Jim Brady.How are we gonna get outta here?How are we gonna eat?- We'll walk. If we have to, we'll starve.- There's that ""we"" again.Not that way. We don't wannarun into Spats and his chums.Your hands clean?Over.OK, button my spats.You sure dress nice, boss.Say, boss. I've been talkingwith the other delegates.The word is, Little Bonaparte is real soreover what happened to Toothpick Charlie.- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.He even got Charlie's last toothpickfrom the garage. Had it gold-plated.Like I was tellin' you fellas.Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.Hasn't got it here anymore.Used to be like a rock.- It's too bad. I think it's time he retired.- Second the motion.How are we gonna retire him?Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charliewill be singin' in the same choir again.But this time we'll make surethere are no witnesses.Look. The two broads from the elevator.Hey. Join us.What's the matter with those dames?Maybe those dames ain't dames.Same faces, same instruments.- Here's your Valentine's card.- The two musicians from the garage.They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,so we'll finish the job here. Come on.- All right, so what do we do now?- First we gotta get out of these clothes.What happened?Me and Tiny had them cornered,but we lost them in the shuffle.- Where were you guys?- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.- Why, you stupid idiot.- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.They can't be too far away.Thank you.Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.It's been ten years since I elected myselfpresident of this organization,and, if I say so myself,you made the right choice.Let's look at the record.In the last fiscal year,we made $112 million before taxes.Only we ain't payin' no taxes.Of course, like in every business,we had our little misunderstandings.Let us now observe one minute of silencein memory of seven of our membersfrom Chicago, North Side Chapter,who are unable to be with us tonighton account of bein' rubbed out.You too, Spats.Up.Easy, now.- You know when you come out?- Yeah. Second time they sing:For he's a jolly good fellowwhich nobody can deny.OK.And don't mess up the cake. I promisedto bring back a piece to my kids.Now, fellow delegates,there comes a time in the lifeof every business executivewhen he starts thinkin' about retirement.No!I'm lookin' aroundfor somebody to fill my shoes.I've been considerin' several candidates.For instance, there'sa certain party from Chicago,South Side Chapter.Now, some people sayhe's gotten a little too big for his spats.But I say he's a man who'll go far.Some people say he's gone too far.But I say,you can't keep a good man down.Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.The big noise he madeon St Valentine's Day,that wasn't very good for public relations.And lettin' them two witnesses get away.That sure was careless.Don't worry about those two.They're as good as dead.I almost caught up with them today.You mean you let 'em get away twice?Some people would saythat's real sloppy.But I say: To err is human,to forgive divine.And just to show youwhat I think of you, Spats,the boys told meyou was gonna have a birthday.So we baked you a little cake.My birthday?Why, it ain't for another four months.So we're a little early.What's a few months between friends?All right, boys. Now all together.For he's a jolly good fellowFor he's a jolly good fellowFor he's a jolly good fellowWhich nobody can denyWhich nobody can denyWhich nobody can denyFor he's a jolly good fellowFor he's a jolly good fellowFor he's a jolly good fellowWhich nobody can denyBig joke.Let's get outta here.Get those two guys.What happened here?There was somethin' in that cakethat didn't agree with 'em.My compliments to the chef. Nobodyleaves this room till I get the recipe.You wanna make a federal case of it?Yeah.They slipped through our hands.We're watchin' the train station, roadsand airport. They can't get away.- Did you hear that?- But they're not watching yachts.- You're gonna call Osgood.- What'll I tell him?Tell him you're gonna elope with him.Elope? But there are laws, conventions.There's a convention, all right.There's also the ladies' morgue.Josephine.Bienstock!Hey. That's no dame.None of that, Sugar.No guy is worth it.Grab her.Josephine?- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.- We're not on the pier yet.Hi.My friend Josephine,gonna be a bridesmaid.- Pleased to meet you.- Come on.She's so eager.Wait for Sugar!- Another bridesmaid?- Flower girl.- Sugar, what are you doing?- I told you, I'm not very bright.Let's go.You don't want me, Sugar.I'm a liar and a phony.A saxophone player.One of those no-goodniksyou keep running away from.I know. Every time.Sugar, do yourself a favor.Go back to the millionaires.The sweet end of the lollipop,not the coleslaw in the faceand the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.I called Mama.She was so happy, she cried.She wants you to haveher wedding gown. It's white lace.Osgood, I can't get marriedin your mother's dress.She and I, we are not built the same way.- We can have it altered.- Oh no, you don't.Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.We can't get married at all.Why not?Well...In the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.Doesn't matter.I smoke. I smoke all the time.I don't care.I have a terrible past. For three yearsI've been living with a saxophone player.I forgive you.I can never have children.- We can adopt some.- You don't understand, Osgood.- I'm a man.- Well,nobody's perfect.Subtitles by VisiontextDVDRIP by Feedback Overflow.","polarity 0.007,subjectivity 0.567"
